## Release Pipeline Groups
Release Pipeline Groups allows us to categorize each Release Pipeline. 

For example, say we had an integration project with multiple production releases (for exampe release 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, and so on). We may choose to create a seperate Release Pipeline for each release, but place them in the same Released Pipeline Group.

> Note: It is intended that reporting capabilities to be delivered in future versions of MyST will provide reporting by Release Pipeline Groups. For example, allowing production of a report that shows all active release pipelines for a particular Pipeline Group.

### List Release Pipeline Groups
