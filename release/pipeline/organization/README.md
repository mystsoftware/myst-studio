Pipeline Groups and Stream Types are user defined. These allow us to categorize Release Pipelines and each Stream within a Release Pipeline.

> It is intended that in future releases of MyST, these categories will be used for reporting purposes.

This chapter contains the following sections:
* [7.1.1 - Pipeline Groups](/release/pipeline/organization/groups/README.md)

* [7.1.2 - Stream Types](/release/pipeline/organization/stream-types/README.md)
