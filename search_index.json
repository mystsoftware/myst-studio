All with Zero Scripting.\nThis allows users to transform what is typically a resource intensive and highly error prone process into one that is automated, predictable and low risk.\nIn this guide we will learn about using MyST to deliver Automation, Auditability and Governance of Platform Change and Application Release for Oracle Middleware.\nWhen following the User Guide you will need to have access to MyST Studio. For details on installing MyST please visit the MyST Studio Installation Guide.\n"},"introduction/platform-provisioning/":{"url":"introduction/platform-provisioning/","title":"Platform Provisioning and Configuration","keywords":"","body":"Platform Provisioning and Configuration\nRubicon Red MyST delivers automated platform provisioning and configuration management for Oracle Middleware, on premise and on cloud, enabling users to deliver a consistent and reliable platform in minutes, NOT weeks or months.\nRubicon Red MyST uses a declarative approach to automation, meaning users simply define the target state of the Oracle Middleware infrastructure to be deployed which, at the push of a button, is automatically provisioned by MyST.\nWithin MyST, the target state is captured in the “platform definition”, which is divided into two layers:\n\nFirst, the Platform Blueprint: this is an environment agnostic specification used to define the platform topology and configuration of your Oracle Middleware. This provides an abstraction layer over the underlying infrastructure allowing you to define a single Blueprint for all environments.\n\nSecond, the Platform Model: this overlays the environment specific configurations.\n\n\nFor each environment, we create a separate platform model to define all the environment specific configuration information.\nSplitting the “platform definition” into two layers provides infrastructure independence, enabling you to provision consistent middleware platforms across all environments regardless of infrastructure type, on premise and on cloud.\nCreating a platform blueprint, platform model, and provisioning a new fully operational FMW environment is a simple three step process which can be performed in minutes.\n\nMost Oracle Middleware products run on Oracle WebLogic Application Server. WebLogic supports the concept of a Domain to group related clusters and servers. Some organisations use separate domains for each business unit or capability, others use it to group computational workload. How it is used is up to the organisation. For Oracle products that run on WebLogic, a Platform Blueprint represents a logical definition of a WebLogic domain. For this reason, it is typical for a separate blueprint to be created in MyST Studio for each unique WebLogic domain type in an enterprise (e.g. SOA, ADF)\n\nMiddleware Infrastructure as Code\nThis declarative approach to defining target state enables MyST to treat Oracle Middleware infrastructure as code. Platform Blueprints and Platform Models are put under version control, allowing you to easily propose, review, test, promote and deploy configuration changes across all your environments.\nThis means incremental configuration changes are simple to make and propagate across all environments. Users just update the required target state; MyST will determine and perform the required steps to apply the necessary changes. With MyST there is no need to maintain complicated scripts or workflows for each configuration change, thereby eliminating human errors and simplifying on-going maintenance.\nThis capability, combined with MyST’s comprehensive governance and role based access control, enforces consistent configuration of your Oracle middleware platforms across all environments, on premise and on cloud. As a result, configuration drift, a major cause of unplanned outages, becomes a thing of the past, ensuring that code gets developed and tested in environments closely aligned to Production, for more successful deployments.\nDiscover and Manage Existing Environments\nMyST allows you to discover and manage existing environments. Simply point MyST at the existing middleware platform; MyST will introspect the platform instance and create a corresponding Platform Blueprint and Model.\nYou then use MyST to manage on-going configuration changes for the introspected platform and provision new environments with the same configuration. For example, you may want to re-provision your Dev and Test environments to ensure that their configurations are consistent with Production.\nEnables Hybrid Cloud\nWith built in support for Oracle Cloud and Amazon Web Services, MyST enables you to define a standard process for delivering Oracle Middleware on premise and on cloud.\nMyST provides cloud independence, allowing you to move your middleware infrastructure across different cloud providers as well as providing a path for migrating on-premise platforms to the cloud.\nIntegrated Process for Managing Configuration Change\nMyST Release Pipelines allow you to establish a single integrated process for automating the promotion of Oracle Middleware platform configurations through each stage of the software delivery lifecycle.\nThe powerful configuration management features in Release Pipelines provide the option to combine platform configuration changes and application deployments into a single release.\nThe Release Pipeline Dashboard provides a ‘single pane of glass’ to monitor and manage the promotion of platform configuration changes through staging environments into Production.\nOperational Agility\nDesigned specifically for Oracle Middleware, Rubicon Red MyST enables you to quickly establish a standardized, repeatable and automated process across your organization for provisioning Oracle Middleware infrastructure and managing on-going configuration change. \nMyST provides organizations with the visibility, control and operational agility to consistently and repeatedly deliver Oracle Middleware solutions faster and with less risk\n"},"introduction/application-release-automation/":{"url":"introduction/application-release-automation/","title":"Application Release Automation","keywords":"","body":"Application Release Automation\nRubicon Red MyST is the most advanced and intuitive Application Release Automation solution for Oracle Middleware. It enables you to quickly establish a standardized, repeatable and automated process across your organization for the build and deployment of Oracle Middleware applications at each stage in the Software Delivery Pipeline. All with Zero Scripting.\nMyST shifts the experience from a slow, resource intensive and highly error prone process to a fast, reliable and low risk process that can be performed in a fraction of the time. \nDeclarative Application Deployment\nMyST uses a declarative approach to automation, meaning users simply define the target state of the application to be deployed which, at the push of a button, is automatically deployed by MyST.\nWithin MyST, Application Blueprints are used to (1) define the artifacts to be deployed, (2) define the configuration requirements for each artifact and (3) define the configuration changes to be applied to the Oracle Middleware platform. \nApplication Models allow you to specify properties that are environment dependent, which enables seamless automated deployments across test and production environments. Application Blueprints and Models are version controlled, providing complete control over all configuration changes.\nThe declarative approach means incremental changes are simple to make and propagate across all environments. Users just update the required target state; MyST will determine and perform the required steps to apply the necessary changes.  With MyST there is no need to maintain complicated scripts or workflows for each deployment instance, eliminating errors and simplifying on-going maintenance.\nRepeatable, Reliable Process for Deploying Releases\nMyST Release Pipelines allow you to establish a standardized process for automating the deployment of Oracle Middleware applications through each stage of the software delivery lifecycle.\nThe powerful configuration management features in Release Pipelines enable you to combine multiple applications into a single release, as well as deploy a release across multiple WebLogic domains.\nThe Release Pipeline Dashboard provides a ‘single pane of glass’ to monitor and manage the promotion of application changes and platform configuration changes through staging environments and into Production.\nGovernance and Control\nFine-grained, customizable permissions and approvals provide gating that lets you control who can approve and promote releases into each environment. In addition, automatic audit trails ensure you can meet compliance and governance requirements.\nIntegrates with Existing Build Processes\nMyST has plugins for popular continuous integration tools including Jenkins, Git, TeamCity and Bamboo; this allows you to seamlessly integrate MyST into existing build processes.\nThe output of each build is stored in a software repository, such as Artifactory or Nexus. MyST automatically tracks artifact versions as they change, including the revision of the source code used for each build. \nEnd-to-End Traceability\nMyST provides an inventory that shows which applications, artifacts, and configurations have been deployed to which environments along with dates, times and versions.\nThis provides end-to-end visibility and traceability from the version of the artifact deployed in each environment back to the revision of the source code used to build that artifact, as well as allowing detailed comparisons between what is deployed in each environment in the Release Pipeline.\n"},"platform/security/":{"url":"platform/security/","title":"Security Salt and Hash","keywords":"","body":"Security Salt and Hash\nIn MyST Studio 6.6.0 (introduced in rc2) there were password security enhancements to how MyST encrypts passwords. This article explains the changes to the enhanced password encryption.     \n       \n     \nBefore and After Password Security Enhancement\nBefore 6.6.0 (rc2)\nIn previous versions passwords were encrypted in AES format seen as:\nmy.custom.password={AES}AZ12azasfdASDF9876asdf\\=\\=\nAfter 6.6.0 (rc2)\nPasswords are now hashed with a salt and seen as:\nmy.custom.password=ENC(abcZYX123!@#abcABC123)\nSome additional points to be aware of:\n\nA salt (file) is generated on initial startup and used to hash myst password properties./opt/myst/data/key\nOn initial startup the myst studio database populates an entry to flag that a salt has been generated. This prevents a new salt file being generated and overwriting the previous.\n\nWhat does this mean for existing users?\nUsers upgrading to the new password security enhancement will find their existing passwords remain {AES} encrypted. To use the new salt, simply update existing password properties and myst will use the salt and hash the password as ENC().\nImportance of Backing up the key\nIt is important backup the key as it is uniquely generated on initial startup.\nEvery password which is encrypted using the key can only be decrypted correctly using the same key. \nExtracting the key for backup purposes\nUse below commands to view the key contents.\nNote: The key file supports 15 characters with no new line character.\n# Print the key contents to standard out\ndocker exec -ti myststudio_web /bin/bash -c 'cat /opt/myst/data/key'\n\n# Copy the key file\ndocker cp myststudio_web:/opt/myst/data/key /tmp/key'\nCreating the key for backup purposes\nAlternatively you can create the key.

In addition, MyST also supports the creation of cloud based hosts on-demand for some cloud environments.\nEach host in MyST has a corresponding Compute Definition, is associated with an Infrastructure Provider, and is tagged to one or more Environment Types.\nInfrastructure Provider\nAn Infrastructure Provider typically maps to a data center or a cloud provider region. MyST supports two types of infrastructure providers:\n\nPre-Existing\n: A Pre-Existing infrastructure provider is one where the hosts onto which the Oracle Middleware will be provisioned have been set-up and configured externally to MyST. This can be used with any existing bare-metal, virtual machines (such as VMWare, Oracle VM) or cloud providers (such as Oracle Cloud, AWS or Azure) that we want to use as the target hosts for our Oracle Middleware platforms. \nOn Demand (AWS)\n: An On-Demand (AWS) infrastructure provider is one where hosts will be created on-demand as part of the process of provisioning the Oracle Middleware platform. This approach relies upon an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), which is a Virtual Machine template, for creation of the target hosts that underpin the Oracle Middleware platforms.\n\nBefore registering a host or machine image with MyST it should be setup to conform to the Host Prerequisites.\nEnvironment Types\nEnvironment Types\n are typically aligned to the software delivery lifecycle (for example DEV, SIT, UAT and PROD) and are designed to help categorize Oracle Middleware Platform Instances for governance purposes. This categorization can help to manage who has access to instances, and what actions they can perform against the instance. \nCompute Definitions\nCompute Definitions\n are used to indicate operating system requirements for hosts. When we create a Platform Blueprint, we need to specify its Compute Definition. This is used to define the operating system requirements for target host as well as how MyST should interact with the host.

This categorization can help to manage who has access to instances, and what type of actions they can perform against the instance. For example:\n\nWho can provision and re-provision a platform instance?\nWho is allowed to perform platform configuration changes?\nWho is able to stop/start a platform instance?\nWho is able to deploy/promote code into an environment?\n\nWithin MyST, any resource that is environment specific, such as a Platform Model, Platform Instance, Stream Stage or Application Model, is tagged to an Environment Type. This, in conjunction with Role Based Access Control (RBAC), allows us to control who can perform which actions in which environment.\nIn addition, target hosts (see Pre-Existing Infrastructure Providers) can be tagged to one or more Environment Types. When we create a Platform Model, only the hosts tagged to the same Environment Type as the Platform Model can be selected within the model. This makes it simple to restrict the infrastructure that a given Platform can be targeted to.\nList Environment Types\nTo see a list of defined Environment Types, click  Infrastructure > Environment Types.

This is used to define the operating system requirements for target servers (i.e Virtual or Bare Metal) that will be used by any Platform Model based on the Platform Blueprint.\nWhen provisioning Platform Instances from a Blueprint on pre-existing target hosts, the Compute Definition tells MyST how it should interact with target hosts. For example, if the Compute Definition is for Solaris then MyST will know to treat the platform as if it is Solaris, instead of say Oracle Linux.\nThe Compute Definition specifies the following details about the host operating system:\n\nOS Type - The operating system type, for example Linux, Solaris.\nOS Distribution - The operating system distribution, for example Oracle Linux, RedHat Linux.\nOS Architecture - The chip architecture for the operating system, for example x86-64.\nOS Version - The version of the operating system, for example Oracle Linux 7.\n\nUse of Compute Definitions for Pre-Existing Infrastructure\nWhen adding a target host to a Pre-Existing Infrastructure Provider, we need to specify its compute definition.\nWhen we create a Platform Model to provision a middleware platform to Pre-Existing Infrastructure, one of the steps is to map the target hosts to the model. Only those target hosts which have the same Compute Definition as the Platform Blueprint are available to be assigned to the Platform Model. This feature prevents provisioning and deployment to incompatible target environments. For example, we should not be able to deploy a Platform Blueprint optimised for Solaris to a Linux target host, or vice versa, as it may lead to unintended runtime consequences.\nUse of Compute Definitions for AWS On-Demand Infrastructure\nWhen creating a Platform Model for AWS On-Demand, then the Compute Definition is used to map to the Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

This approach relies upon a machine image which is used as a template for the Virtual Machines that are created to underpin the Oracle Middleware platforms\n\nPre-Configuring Hosts\nIn Unix/Linux, root is the account that by default has access to all commands and files on the operating system. It is a heavily guarded privilege which of course should not be given out lightly. MyST keeps it simple and does not need any root privileges to roll out Oracle Middleware platforms. By default, MyST will assume that root-privileged actions have already been performed on the host by a system administrator at the time that it uses the hosts for provisioning.\nWhen using a Cloud provider such as Amazon Web Services, an administrator or automation tool can pre-configure a Linux host with the root-privileged actions and create a template. That way, when MyST provisions Oracle Middleware platforms from scratch on a Cloud, it can use the template as the basis for the Linux hosts. This means that the root privileged actions only need to be performed once which improves security, reduces effort and results in consistent base Linux hosts for all Oracle Middleware platforms.\n\nPre-Configuring Middleware Host\nA target Linux host for Oracle Middleware typically requires root privileges to set up a number of prerequisite operating system dependencies. As such, these dependencies are often best addressed by a privileged user or tool prior to using MyST Studio to provision Oracle Middleware on to them. These dependencies are as follows:\n\nVerify that your operating system is certified and properly configured for installation and configuration.\nInstall a certified Java JDK\nVerify that the installation user has the proper permissions to install and configure the software.\nVerify that you can create the necessary directories for installation and configuration, according to the recommended directory structure.\nMake the Oracle installation binaries available\n\nOperating System Requirements\nThe following section provides a high-level overview of the minimum system requirements that need to be put in place prior to installing Oracle Fusion Middleware. You should consult the corresponding Oracle Fusion Middleware system requirements documentation to ensure that your environment meets the requirements. \n\nOracle Fusion Middleware 12.2.1\nOracle Fusion Middleware 12.1.3\nOracle Fusion Middleware 11.1.1.x\n\nNote: These documents cover the minimum requirements for the Oracle products you are installing and details hardware and software requirements, database schema requirements, minimum disk space and memory requirements, and required system libraries, packages, or patches.\nEnabling Unicode Support\nOracle recommends that you enable Unicode support by setting the LANG and LC_ALL environment variables to a locale with the UTF-8 character set. This enables the operating system to process any character in Unicode.\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nLANG\nThis environment variable sets the installation default locale. For example: setenv LANG en_US.UTF-8\n\n\nLC_ALL\nThis environment variable overrides the value of the LANG environment variable and the values of any other LC_* environment variables. For example: setenv LC_ALL en_US.UTF-8\n\n\n\nSetting Open File and Processes Limit\nAdd the following lines to the file /etc/security/limits.conf\n* soft  nofile  4096\n* hard  nofile  65536\n* soft  nproc   2047\n* hard  nproc   16384\nThe nofiles values represent the open file limit; the nproc values represent the number of processes limit.\nIf you are running Oracle Linux 6 or Red Hat Linux 6. Make sure the same values are defined in the file /etc/security/limits.d/90-nproc.conf as these can override the values in the limits.conf file.\nVerify the required packages on the target hosts\nThe following table lists the packages that must be available on the target hosts where you want to install MyST Studio. It is recommended that you consult the Oracle Fusion Middleware system requirements documentation to confirm the exact version of these packages needed by the version of Oracle Middleware being installed.\n\n\n\nPackage Name\n\n\n\n\nbinutils\n\n\ncompat-libcap1\n\n\ncompat-libstdc++-33.x86_64\n\n\ncompat-libstdc++-33.i686\n\n\ngcc\n\n\ngcc-c++\n\n\nglibc.x86_64\n\n\nglibc.i686\n\n\nglibc-devel.i686\n\n\nlibaio-devel\n\n\nlibgcc\n\n\nlibstdc++.x86_64\n\n\nlibstdc++.i686\n\n\nlibstdc++-devel\n\n\nmake\n\n\nsysstat\n\n\nunzip\n\n\n\nTable 1. Packages required on the target hosts\nThe simplest way to ensure that all of the necessary packages are installed is to use the following commands:\nsudo yum install oracle-rdbms-server-12cR1-preinstall\nsudo yum install libstdc++-devel.i686\nsudo yum install compat-libstdc++-33 compat-libstdc++-33.i686\n\nClock Synchronization\nThe clocks of all servers participating in the cluster must be synchronized to within one second difference to enable proper functioning of jobs, adapters, and Oracle B2B. \nTo accomplish this, use a single network time server and then point each server to that network time server.\nInstall Java JDK\nWe must have a version of Java Hotspot installed on each target host. This is required by the MyST agent runtime (this dependency will be removed in a future version).\nOpen JDK is not supported by Fusion Middleware so be sure to use the Oracle JDK.\nFor more information see Installing Java on Linux.\nNote 1:  \n\nOracle Fusion Middleware 12.2.1 requires Java 8  \nOracle Fusion Middleware 12.1.3 and prior requires Java 7  \n\nIf you are planning on provisioning both Middleware versions on the same target hosts, ensure that both Java versions are installed and that you are referencing the correct Java home in your Platform Blueprint. This is covered in more detail in the Provisioning Section. \nNote 2:Due to a known issue with the MyST Studio SSH client, you need to create a symbolic link from /usr/bin/java to your actual java binary. For example, if your Java Home is at /usr/java/latest, run the following command on each host:\nln -s /usr/java/latest/bin/java /usr/bin/java\n\nNote 3:There is a known bug in java that can impact the performance of the Weblogic Scripting Tool (WLST).  To workaround this issue, we need to edit the file /jre/lib/security/java.security\n\nComment out the line:#securerandom.source=file:/dev/urandom\n\nAdd the following line:securerandom.source=file:/dev/./urandom\n\n\nConfiguring operating system users and groups\nWe need to create the operating system user that owns the Oracle software on each target host. \nWhen MyST installs the Oracle Middleware it will require Secure Shell (SSH) access to the target host. MyST supports user credentials provided either as password or as public key (see Configuring Infrastucture Providers for details).\nGroups\nWe need to create the following groups on each target host:\n\noinstall\ndba\n\nUsers\nYou must create the following users on each target host:\n\noracle – The user that owns the Oracle software. You may use a different name1. The primary group for this account must be oinstall. The account must also be in the dba group.\n\nnobody – An unprivileged user.\n\n\nNote:\n\nEach group must have the same Group ID on every node.\nEach user must have the same User ID on every node.\n\nTo create oracle user and group, do the following:\nsh\nsudo /usr/sbin/groupadd oinstall\nsudo /usr/sbin/groupadd dba\nsudo /usr/sbin/useradd -m -g oinstall -G dba oracle\npasswd oracle\nThe operating system user and group must have read and write access to the following directories: \n\n/u01/app/oracle2\n/opt/myst\n/tmp/mystWorkspace\n\nImportant - If any of these directories do not exist, please create them and make sure that the operating system user can read and write to them.\n1 If you use a different name for the Oracle user or group, you must update the MyST global variables oui.install.user and oui.install.group in the Platform Blueprint.\n2 /u01/app/oracle is the default base directory under which Oracle products are installed.

For example, you may want to re-provision your Dev and Test environments to ensure that the configuration of these environments is consistent with Production.\nSide-by-Side Automated Upgrade\nMyST provides a simple and automated process for side-by-side upgrades. MyST allows you to introspect an existing 11g environment to create a corresponding 11g Platform Blueprint.\nNext, just specify the Oracle Middleware 12c version required. MyST will automatically update the blueprint to one that is compliant with the Oracle Enterprise Deployment Guide for SOA 12c, whilst preserving your 11g configurations. This can then be used to provision an equivalent 12c Oracle Middleware platform.\nBuilt-in Version Control\nPlatform Blueprints and Platform Models are put under version control, allowing you to easily edit, review, test, promote and deploy configuration changes across all your environments.\nThis means incremental configuration changes are simple to make and propagate across all environments. Users just update the Platform Blueprint / Model to reflect the required target state; MyST will determine and perform the required steps to apply the necessary changes. \nMyST Release Pipelines allow you to establish a single integrated process for automating the promotion of Oracle Middleware platform configurations through each stage of the software delivery lifecycle.\nEnables Hybrid Cloud\nWith built-in support for Oracle Cloud and Amazon Web Services, MyST enables you to define a standard process for delivering Oracle Middleware on premise and on cloud.\nMyST provides cloud independence, allowing you to move your middleware infrastructure across different cloud providers as well as providing a path for migrating on-premise platforms to the cloud.\nCreating a platform blueprint, platform model, and provisioning a new fully operational FMW environment is a simple three step process which can be performed in minutes.\nIn the Platform Fundamentals section we will look at:\n\nPlatform Modeling\n\nCreating Platform Blueprints   \n\nUnderstanding Platform Templates\n\nCreating Platform Models\n\nEditing Platform Blueprints and Models\n\nVersion Control\nWeb-based Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomated Provisioning\n\nProvisioning Platform Instances\n\n\n\n\nAutomated Change Management\n\nUpdating Platform Configuration\n\nManaging a Platform Instance\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomated Discovery\n\nIntrospecting an existing WebLogic Domain\n\n\n\n\nAutomated Upgrade\n\nSide-by-Side Automated Upgrade\n\n\n\n"},"platform/blueprints/":{"url":"platform/blueprints/","title":"Platform Blueprints","keywords":"","body":"Platform Blueprints\nRubicon Red MyST uses a declarative approach to automation, meaning users simply define the target state of the Oracle Middleware infrastructure to be deployed which, at the push of a button, is automatically provisioned by MyST.\nWithin MyST, the target state is captured in the “platform definition”, which is divided into two layers:\n\nFirst, the Platform Blueprint: this an environment agnostic specification used to define the platform topology and configuration of your Oracle Middleware. This provides an abstraction layer over the underlying infrastructure, allowing you to define a single Blueprint for all environments.\n\nSecond, the Platform Model: this maps the Platform Blueprint to the target infrastructure and overlays the environment specific configurations.\n\n\nFor each platform instance, we create a separate platform model to define all the environment specific configuration information. This approach provides a number of benefits, including:\n\nConsistency - Configuration across all environments, from Development through to Production, is managed through a centralized Platform Blueprint.\nInfrastructure Independence - Enabling you to provision consistent middleware platforms across all environments regardless of infrastructure type, on premise and on cloud\nReliability - Through automation MyST will reduce risk by bringing platforms to a desired state no matter what the initial state of the target platform is. This is known as idempotency \nFlexibility - Environment specific overrides can be applied through Platform Models, allowing for configuration differences to be safely managed.\nGovernance - Platform Blueprint and Platform Models are version controlled. Release Pipelines provide complete control in promoting configuration changes across environments. \nSimplicity - Easy-to-use graphical editor for defining target state of Oracle Middleware configuration. There is no need to write scripts or have specialist skills in a programming language\n\nMost Oracle Middleware products run on Oracle WebLogic Application Server. WebLogic supports the concept of a Domain to group related clusters and servers. Some organizations use separate domains for each business unit or capability, others use it to group computational workload. How it is used is up to the organization. \nFor Oracle products that run on WebLogic, a Platform Blueprint represents a logical definition of a WebLogic domain. For this reason, it is typical for a separate blueprint to be created in MyST Studio for each unique WebLogic domain type in an enterprise (e.g. SOA, ADF)\n\nThere are three ways in which you can create a Platform Blueprint:\n\nWizard: This guides the user through a simple process to capture the key design decisions for the Oracle Middleware topology and configuration and creates a corresponding Platform Blueprint.\nTemplate: Choose from a set of pre-defined Rubicon Red certified templates to build your blueprint or use a template that you have previously created.\nIntrospection: Use MyST to discover and introspect an existing WebLogic Domain and create a corresponding Platform Blueprint.\n\nCreating a Platform Blueprint using the Wizard\nMyST Studio provides a wizard which guides the user through the end-to-end process of designing your Platform Blueprint. The wizard is used to capture key design decisions, such as:\n\nWhich Oracle Middleware product, version and components do want in your platform? \nWhat topology do you want? For example, do you want\nA separate web-tier layer?\nSeparate layers per product component?\nAn isolated admin server?\n\n\nWhat constraints do you want to add to your platform? For example, what is:\nThe minimum and maximum cluster size?\nThe target operating system?\n\n\nWhat additional platform capabilities do you want to configure? For example:\nDo you want encrypted listen addresses for your WebLogic Servers?\nDo you want to persist TLogs and JMS Stores to the database or file system?\nDo you require GridLink data sources for Oracle Middleware product schemas?\n\n\n\nBased on the answers provided, MyST will generate an Oracle EDG Compliant Platform Blueprint which can then be used to install and configure your Oracle Middleware Platform.\nLaunching the Platform Blueprint Wizard\nFrom the side menu navigate toModeling > Platform Blueprint. This will display a list of existing Platform Blueprints. Click on Create New in the top right-hand corner of the screen. This will launch the New Platform Blueprint wizard.\n     \n       \n     \nIn the initial dialog, we need to specify the following details about our Platform Blueprint:\n\nName - Shorthand name for the Platform Blueprint\nDescription - A longer description of the Platform Blueprint\nWorkspaces - This defines the Workspaces to which the Platform Blueprint belongs. See Role-Based Access Control for further details.\nInitial Version - Specifies the initial version of the Platform Blueprint. See Platform Blueprint and Model Versioning for further details.\n\nFinally, we need to specify how we want to create the Platform Blueprint. Keep the default selection of Wizard. Then click Next.\nSpecify Oracle Middleware Components\nThe next stage is to select which Oracle Middleware components are to be included within our Platform Blueprint. First, select the Oracle Middleware Product Catalog in which we are interested, this could be one of:\n\nIntegration and Process Management\nSocial Business and Collaboration\nBusiness Intelligence\nIdentity Management\n\nNext specify the Oracle Middleware version (for example 11.1.1.7, 12.1.3, 12.2.1.0, 12.2.1.3). For the specified Oracle Middleware Product Catalog and Version, MyST will list the components that are available for inclusion within the Platform Blueprint.\n     \n       \n     \nFinally select the required Oracle Middleware components to be included within your Platform Blueprint. You will notice that MyST automatically selects any mandatory components, for example, if you select Oracle B2B then Oracle SOA Suite will automatically be selected. \nEach Platform Blueprint can only include components from a single Product Catalog. Components that are supported in multiple Product Catalogs (e.g. Web Services Manager) appear in all the applicable Product Catalogs.\n\nOnce all components have been specified, click Next.\nSpecify Compute Groups\nIntroduction to Compute Groups\nWithin MyST, Compute Groups are used to specify the logical topology of our WebLogic Domain.\nWhen we layout out our WebLogic Domain, it is common to target different component types, such as the Web Tier, Oracle Service Bus and Oracle SOA to different groups of virtual or physical servers.  \nIn Production, for example, we could have a WebLogic Domain consisting of four Oracle Service Bus managed servers, two SOA managed servers and a web-tier consisting of two Oracle HTTP servers.  \nIt is also common for Non-Production environments, such as Continuous Integration (CI), System Integration Testing (SIT) and Pre-Production (PRE) to vary in size. For example, we may have a 4 node OSB cluster in Prod and Pre-Prod, with a two node OSB cluster in UAT and SIT and just a single node OSB and SOA (cluster) for CI.  \nAs we have already mentioned, a core objective of MyST is to enable you to use a single Platform Blueprint for all these environments, so we can ensure that each of these environments has an identical configuration and prevent issues caused by configuration drift.  \nCompute groups in MyST allow us to specify the rules for targeting component-types to specific groups of servers, as well as specify the default, minimum and maximum number of nodes in the compute group, with the actual number of nodes in the compute group being specified as part of the Platform Model, but within the constraints specified by the Platform Blueprint. This provides the flexibility required to use a single Platform Blueprint across all environments.  \nThe other consideration when specifying our domain topology, is whether to have a stand-alone admin node, in other words, whether to deploy it to its own compute group, or include it within an existing compute group.  \nAs the admin server cannot be clustered, when selecting a stand-alone admin node, MyST will set the maximum number of nodes to one. When including it within an existing compute group, MyST will only provision the admin server to the first node in the compute group.\nIf you select a stand-alone admin server in the Platform Blueprint, you still have the option of overriding this in the Platform Model. This provides an additional level of flexibility, as you may want a stand-alone admin server in Production, but to co-locate it with another managed server in some environments in order to save resources.\n \nDefine Compute Group\nTo define the Compute Groups that we want in our Platform Blueprint, we first need to specify the following values:\n\nStand-alone Admin Node - From the drop-down, select whether you want to have a stand-alone admin server (Yes) or include it within an existing Compute Group (No)\nNumber of Compute Groups - From the drop-down, select the required number of Compute Groups.\n\n     \n       \n     \nFor each Compute Group, we need to specify the following values:\n\nName - Provide a short name (such as web, soa, osb) for the Compute Group.\nComponents - Click on the appropriate check boxes to add the required components to a Compute Group. Note: A component can only belong to a single Compute Group, so selecting it for one Compute Group will automatically deselect it from its previous Compute Group.\nNode Constraints - Specify the default, minimum and maximum number of nodes in the Compute Group. When creating a Platform Model, it will use the default value for the number of nodes. This can then be modified with the minimum and maximum constraints.\n\nFinally, we need to select from the drop-down the target compute definition for all target hosts that will be used within each Compute Group.\nCluster Grouping\nBy default, MyST follows the Oracle Enterprise Deployment Guide and hosts individual components within separate WebLogic clusters.\nHowever, there may be instances where you might want to host more than one component in the same WebLogic cluster. To allow for this, you can choose Yes for Enable Cluster Grouping in this step and associate a logical label for the components you want to group together.\n     \n       \n     \nHere, we have enabled cluster grouping and associated the label, soagroup with both Oracle SOA Suite and Oracle Service Bus. This will result in them being co-hosted inside the same cluster as shown below\n     \n       \n     \nNote that cluster grouping is not supported for all product combinations as of now. The only combinations which we support are\n\nOracle SOA Suite + Oracle Service Bus\nOracle SOA Suite + Oracle Enterprise Scheduler\nOracle Service Bus + Oracle Enterprise Scheduler\n\n\nOnce done, click Next.\nSpecify Other Key Configurations\nThe final stage is to specify a number of other key configuration decisions for the Platform Blueprint. \n     \n       \n     \nMyST will default these options based on the most common configurations, we should update these details as required for our Platform Blueprint. These are:\n\nWebLogic Domain Name - Specify an appropriate WebLogic Domain Name.\nEnable Standard Listen Ports - This option is selected by default and can only be disabled if you enable SSL Listen Ports.\nEnable SSL Listen Ports - Select this option to enable SSL listen ports for the WebLogic Servers in the domain.\nEnable Administration Port - Select this option to enable the SSL administration port for  all WebLogic Servers in the domain.\nAdministration Port - Specify the port number for the SSL administration port (can only be set if the Administration Port is enabled).\nJDBC Data Source Type - This option is used to specify the Data Source Type for Oracle Middleware specific schemas which are created by the Oracle Middleware Repository Creation Utility (RCU). If using Oracle RAC, then select a GridLink Data Source, otherwise use a Generic Data Source.\nPersistence Strategy - Use this to specify whether TLOGs and JMS Stores are held on the File System or in the Database.\n\nOnce done, click Next.\nReview the Summary\nMyST will display a Summary screen showing all the key inputs specified in the Platform Blueprint Wizard. \n     \n       \n     \nOnce done, click Finish. MyST will create the corresponding Platform Blueprint and take you to the Platform Blueprint Editor where you can make additional changes if required. See Editing Platform Blueprints for further details.\nCreating a Platform Blueprint from a Pre-Defined Template\nMyST comes with a catalog of certified Platform Templates, with \"built-in\" best practices for enterprise deployment of Oracle Middleware. We can use these to create our initial Platform Blueprint.\nMyST also allows us to create our own Platform Templates, which can be used to create our initial Platform Blueprint. This can be useful if we have multiple domains in Production for the same Product Components. For example, we may have multiple SOA domains each designated to a particular line of business. Platform Templates allows us to capture a base \"Platform Blueprint\" that can be re-used to create the Platform Blueprint for each domain.\nLaunching the Platform Blueprint Wizard\nFrom the side menu navigate toModeling > Platform Blueprint, this will display a list of existing Platform Blueprints. Click on Create New in the top right-hand corner of the screen. This will launch the New Platform Blueprint wizard.\n     \n       \n     \nIn the initial screen, we need to specify the following details about our Platform Blueprint:\n\nName - Shorthand name for the Platform Blueprint\nDescription - A longer description of the Platform Blueprint\nWorkspaces - This defines the Workspaces to which the Platform Blueprint belongs. See Role Based Access Control for further details.\nInitial Version - This specifies the initial version of the Platform Blueprint. See Platform Blueprint and Model Versioning for further details.\n\nFinally, we need to specify that we want to use a template to create the Platform Blueprint. Select Templateand click Next.\nSelect Template\nThe next stage is to select which template to use for our Platform Blueprint. \n     \n       \n     \nFrom the drop-down, select the required Platform Template. MyST will display the Platform Template description, allowing you to verify that the correct template has been selected. Once selected, click Next.\nReview the Summary\nMyST will display a Summary screen showing all the key inputs specified in the Platform Blueprint Wizard.\n     \n       \n     \nOnce done, click Finish. MyST will create the corresponding Platform Blueprint and take you to the Platform Blueprint Editor where you can make additional changes if required. See Editing Platform Blueprints for further details.\nOther ways of creating a Platform Blueprint\n\nUsing Introspection - There are scenarios where we might want to reverse-engineer our platform blueprints from pre-existing environments. For such situations, MyST allows one to introspect the platform and discover the existing configuration and create a blueprint out of it. See Introspecting Existing Instances for further details.\nUpgrading from an existing blueprint - This option allows us to upgrade configuration from a lower middleware version to a higher middleware version and create a new blueprint based on the higher version. See Upgrading Instances for further details.\n\n"},"platform/templates/":{"url":"platform/templates/","title":"Platform Templates","keywords":"","body":"Platform Templates\nA Platform Template provides a definition of a specific middleware topology and configuration that can be used as the basis for creating a Platform Blueprint.\nPlatform Templates provide a number of key advantages:\n\nCatalog - Rich set of certified Platform Templates are provided out-of-the-box with MyST Studio, each representing a proven best-practice approach as defined in the Oracle Fusion Middleware Enterprise Deployment Guide  \nReuse - Any number of Platform Blueprints can be created from a Platform Template, enabling the continual reuse of known topologies and configurations, saving time and effort in defining new platforms\nCertified Best Practices - Provide definitions of tested and certified platforms that are based on the documented best practices from Oracle\nKnowledge Capture - Once a Platform Blueprint has been created and approved, it can easily be converted into a Platform Template, preserving all of the knowledge that has been applied to the Platform Blueprint\n\nPlatform Template Catalog\nMyST Studio provides a Catalog containing a set of certified Platform Templates for an array of Fusion Middleware products, with each template representing a best-practice topology based on the Oracle Fusion Middleware Enterprise Deployment Guide.

Both approaches result in the same work flow to create the Platform Blueprint.\nFor a full description of the Platform Blueprint concept, see the Platform Blueprints section.\n\nOption 1: Generate Platform Blueprint from Platform Templates Catalog\nFrom the side menu, navigate to Modeling > Platform Templates.  This will display the platform templates Catalog.  Click the Action > Generate Blueprint option on the desired Platform Template to start the Platform Blueprint creation process.\n     \n       \n     \nThis will launch the New Platform Blueprint wizard with the Platform Template value preset with the chosen template.

This will display a list of existing Platform Blueprints. Click on Create New in the top right-hand corner of the screen. This will launch the New Platform Blueprint wizard.\nEnter a Name and Description for the new blueprint. Select the Template - Create from a set of pre-defined templates option from the list of blueprint create options and click Next to continue.\n     \n       \n     \nFrom the list of available Platform Templates, select the required template on which to base the new blueprint.  Click Next to continue.\n     \n       \n     \n     \n       \n     \nReview the details of the new Platform Blueprint and click Finish to complete the process.\n     \n       \n     \nCreating a Platform Template from a Platform Blueprint\nIn addition to providing pre-defined and certified Platform Templates, MyST Studio also enables custom Platform Templates to be created and published in the catalog.  This is done by saving a Platform Blueprint as a Platform Template, capturing all of the topology definition and configurations that have been made on Platform Blueprint and saving it as a Platform Template.\nSave Blueprint as Template\nFrom the side menu navigate to Modeling > Platform Blueprint. This will display a list of existing Platform Blueprints.  Click on the desired blueprint to open it for viewing.\nFrom the Platform Blueprint editor, click the Actions button and select the Save as Template option.\n     \n       \n     \nA blueprint must be in a committed state before it can be saved as a template.\n\nIn the New Platform Template dialog specify the Name and a Description for the new Platform Template and click Save to complete the process.\n     \n       \n     \nReview and Edit Template\nFrom the side menu navigate to Modeling > Platform Templates. This will display a list of existing Platform Templates.  A new template will be marked with Draft.  Clicking on the template will open it for viewing.\n     \n       \n     \nFor a template in Draft mode, additional changes can be made to its configuration using the Edit Configuration button.  \nPublish Template\nOnce a template has been finalized, it can be published and marked as Final.  This locks the template and prevents any further changes being made to it.\n     \n       \n     \n     \n       \n     \n"},"platform/models/":{"url":"platform/models/","title":"Platform Models","keywords":"","body":"Platform Models\nFor each Platform Instance that we want to create, we need to create a corresponding Platform Model in MyST.\nThe Platform Model maps the Platform Blueprint to the target infrastructure for our Oracle Middleware platform and provides environment specific configuration details. MyST currently supports two types of infrastructure providers:\n\nPre-Existing: A Pre-Existing infrastructure provider is one where the hosts onto which the Oracle Middleware will be provisioned have been set-up and configured externally to MyST. Can be used with any existing bare-metal, virtual machines (such as VMWare, Oracle VM), or cloud providers (such as Oracle Cloud, AWS or Azure) that we want to use as the target for hosting our Oracle Middleware platforms.\n\nOn Demand (AWS): An On-Demand (AWS) infrastructure provider is one where hosts onto which the Oracle Middleware will be provisioned are created on-demand as part of the process of provisioning the Oracle Middleware platform. This approach relies upon an Amazon Machine Image which is used as a template for the Virtual Machines that are created to underpin the Oracle Middleware platforms.\n\n\nWhen we create the Platform Model, we also have the ability to override many of the configurations defined in the Platform Blueprint. This provides a mechanism to safely manage configuration differences between environments. For example, you may want detailed logging levels in a Development or Test environment, but not  in later environments.\nOnce we have created our Platform Model we are then ready to provision a Platform Instance.\nTo learn how to create a Platform Model for provisioning on-top of pre-existing infrastructure it is recommended to follow the guide:\n\nCreating a Platform Model for Pre-Existing Infrastructure\n\nAlternatively, to learn how to create a Platform Model for on-demand provisioning on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud it is recommended to follow the guide:\n\nCreating a Platform Model for On-Demand AWS\n\n"},"platform/models/pre-existing/":{"url":"platform/models/pre-existing/","title":"Pre-Existing Infrastructure","keywords":"","body":"Creating a Platform Model for Pre-Existing Infrastructure\nFrom the side menu navigate toModeling > Platform Model, this will display a list of existing Platform Models.

This will launch the New Platform Model wizard.\n     \n       \n     \nIn the initial dialog, we need to specify the following details about our Platform Model:\n\nPlatform Blueprint - The Platform Blueprint that we will use for our Platform Model.\n\nPlatform Blueprint Version - The version of the Platform Blueprint that we will use for our Platform Model.\n\nEnvironment Type - The Environment Type for the Platform Model.\n\nName - Shorthand name for the Platform Model.\n\nDescription - A longer description of the Platform Model\n\nWorkspaces - This defines the Workspaces to which the Platform Model belongs. See Role-Based Access Control for further details.\n\n\nOnce we have entered the basic details about our Platform Model click Next.\nSelect Infrastructure Provider\nNext, we need to specify the Infrastructure Provider for our Platform Model. From the corresponding drop-down, select Infrastructure Provider of type AWS On-Demand.\nIn the initial dialog, we need to specify the following details about our Platform Model:\n\nVirtual Private Cloud (VPC) - From the corresponding drop-down, select the VPC that you wish to provision your Platform Instance on.\n\nSubnet - From the corresponding drop-down, select the Subnet that you wish to provision your Platform Instance on.\n\n\n     \n       \n     \n\nNote: The available VPCs and Subnets are those configured as part of setting up the AWS On-Demand Infrastructure. See Configuring AWS On-Demand Infrastructure for further details.\n\nOnce done, click Next.\nSpecify Compute Group\nFor each Compute Group defined within the Platform Blueprint we need to specify the following details:\n\nActual Nodes - The number of compute nodes. This will initially be set to the default value within the Platform Blueprint but can be overridden in the Platform Model.\n\nAMI: This is the AMI (Amazon Machine Image) that will be used to create the EC2 instances. This will be automatically set based on the Compute Definition in the Platform Blueprint.\n\nInstance Type - This is the AWS EC2 Instance Type that will be used to create the EC2 instances. \n\nSecurity Group - The security group which will be associated to the EC2 instance.\n\nAgent User - The user on the target host, which MyST will run as.\n\n\n\nThe available AMIs, EC2 Instance Types, Security Groups, Agent Users and OS Users are configured as part of the AWS On-Demand Infrastructure. Where multiple options are available, then a drop-down box is provided to select the required option. Where only a single option is available, then this value will be automatically set.\n\n     \n       \n     \nIn addition, we can also specify whether we want to have a stand-alone admin server, in which case it will be created within its own compute group. MyST will default to what is specified in the Platform Blueprint.\nIf we specified a stand-alone Admin Server in the Platform Blueprint, and then choose to override that, then we will also need to specify which compute group we want to target the Admin Server to.\nOnce done, click Next.\nConfigure Compute Nodes\nOnce we have specified the number of nodes for each compute group, the next step is to configure the compute nodes.\nWe have the option of specifying an AWS Instance Prefix. If specified, the EC2 instance TAG Name of each compute node will be prefixed with this value.\nFor each compute node, in addition, we need to specify: \n\nNode Name -  This is the name of the compute node within the WebLogic domain. The Compute Node Name will also be appended to the AWS Instance Prefix to define the EC2 TAG Name value for the EC2 instance.\n\nIP Address - The IP Address to be assigned to the EC2 instance. Usually, this is left empty, which means that AWS will automatically assign an IP address.\n\n\n     \n       \n     \nOnce done, click Next.\nTag your AWS instances\nAt this step you can optionally provide tags that will be associated with your AWS EC2 instances once they are provisioned.\n     \n       \n     \nOnce done, click Next.\nSpecify Platform Model Configurations\nThe final stage is to specify configuration properties that are specific to the Platform Model.\n     \n       \n     \nFor the Platform Model, we need to specify the following details:\n\nDomain Name - This is the WebLogic Domain name, it will default to the value specified in the Platform Blueprint, but can be overridden in the Platform Model.\nWebLogic Admin User - Enter the WebLogic Admin user, it defaults to Weblogic.\nWeblogic Admin Password - Enter the password to be used for the WebLogic Admin User.\nDatabase Host - The host name for the database that will host the RCU schemas. \nDatabase Port - The port number for the database.\nDatabase Service Name - The service name / SID of the database. \nJDBC Data Source type - This option is used to specify the Data Source Type for Oracle Middleware specific schemas which are created by the Oracle Middleware Repository Creation Utility (RCU). If using AWS RDS Oracle for RCU, then select Generic Datasource (AWS RDS).\nRCU Components - This details the RCU specific schemas that will be created. This is pre-populated based on the Oracle Middleware Components specified in the Platform Blueprint, this is for information purposes only and can't be modified.\nRCU Prefix - Specify the RCU Prefix to be used. The prefix is prepended to and separated from the schema name with an underscore (_) character.\nRCU Database Password Enter the password to be used for each of the schema owners created by RCU.\nRCU SYS User - Enter the user name for the RCU database. This should be a username with DBA or SYSDBA privileges, for example, SYS.\nRCU SYS Password - Enter the password for the RCU Sys User.\n\n\nNote: All passwords stored by MyST are encrypted.\n\nGridLink and ONS nodes configuration\nIn case you are using a GridLink (RAC) database, you can specify the additional property, ONS Nodes and set specify the list of ONS nodes following standard Oracle documentation.\n     \n       \n     \n\nMyST will auto-calculate the GridLink Database URLs as appropriate which you can change in the model editor later if you wish to override.\n\nOverride Default Memory and Logging Settings\nIt is common to have different JVM Memory Arguments and Logging configurations in upstream dev and test environments. The Advanced tab allows you override the settings in the Platform Blueprint.\n     \n       \n     \nFor the Platform Model, we need to specify the following details:\n\nWebLogic Admin Server Memory Arguments - Allows you to specify the JVM Memory arguments for the WebLogic Admin Server.\n\nWebLogic Managed Server Memory Arguments - For each Oracle Middleware Component (for example SOA, OSB and OWSM), allows you to specify the JVM Memory arguments for the WebLogic Managed Server running that component.\n\nLogging / Audit Levels for Oracle Middleware Components - Allows you to specify the Logging / Audit Level for certain Oracle Middleware Components.\n\n\n\n\nNote: The options available will be dependent on which Oracle Middleware components are included within the Platform Blueprint.\n\n\nOnce we have specified the General and Advanced Platform Model configurations, click Next.\nReview the Summary\nMyST will display a Summary screen showing all the key inputs specified in the Platform Model Wizard.\n     \n       \n     \nOnce done, click Finish. MyST will create the corresponding Platform Model and take you to the Platform Model Editor where you can make additional changes if required.

MyST will display summary information about the state of the Platform Model and Instance as shown below.\n     \n       \n     \nClick on the Actions menu and select Provision. MyST will open a dialog with the environment and platform details pre-filled and ask us to provide the remaining information.\n     \n       \n     \n\nVersion - The exact version and revisions of the configuration to provision. By default, the latest version and revisions of the blueprint and model will be selected. Note that only Committed revisions of the configuration would be available here.\nEnvironment already pre-provisoned? - In case, this is an existing platform instance which has already been provisioned (example could be when we have reverse-engineered the instance configuration through introspection), we should check this box. This will not kick off the full provisioning, rather would allow MyST to just do a basic connectivity check with the instance and mark it as provisioned.\nProvisioning Notes - This is to capture any user comments which can be referred to later when finding historic information about actions taken on an instance.\n\nClick on Finish to start the provisioning process.\nMyST will now add the provision action to a task queue. The action will initially be in a PENDING state, but you should shortly see this change to IN PROGRESS as shown below.\n     \n       \n     \nMyST will start the process of provisioning the Oracle Middleware. This includes installing the Oracle Middleware binaries, running RCU to create the database schemas if required, creating the Oracle Middleware domain and then starting it up.\nThe end to end process will typically take 20-60 minutes to complete, depending on the Oracle Middleware components being provisioned and the performance of the underlying infrastructure.\nViewing Logs\nWhilst MyST is provisioning the Platform Instance you can view the action execution log by clicking on the View Log icon under Actions (outlined in red above). This will open the Execution Log dialog as illustrated below.\n     \n       \n     \nIf you leave this window open, MyST will continue to update this with the log output.\nVerify Platform Instance\nOnce our Platform Instance has been successfully provisioned, the log will reflect the same.\n     \n       \n     \n If we look at the summary screen now, the status of the action will change to SUCCESS and the status of the Platform instance will change to ACTIVE.\n     \n       \n     \nWe can now directly go to the instance details screen by following the View instance details link (outlined in red above). Alternatively, we can go to Actions > Instance > View Configuration.\nThis will open the Platform Viewer, where we can view all details about the configuration of the Platform Instance. In addition, MyST provides the URLs for the relevant administration consoles (outlined in red).\n     \n       \n     \nIf we click on the link for the Admin Console, this will take us to the login page for the WebLogic Admin Console.

Once we're happy with our revised platform definition we can run a platform update. MyST will automatically determine and perform the required steps to apply the necessary changes.\nFor the purpose of this section, we are going to walk through the process of adding a new Data Source to our Platform Instance. This involves the following steps:\n\nAdding a Data Source to our Platform Blueprint  \nAdding environment specific details to our Platform Model  \nPerforming an optional dry run to verify our changes  \nPerforming an update against the Platform Instance to apply our changes\n\nUpdate Platform Blueprint\nWhen we update a Platform Blueprint we can either do this as a revision to the current blueprint, assuming its state is not FINAL, or create a new version of the Platform Blueprint. For our example, we are going to create a new version.\nCreate New Version of a Platform Blueprint\nFrom the side menu navigate toModeling > Platform Blueprints, this will display a list of existing Platform Blueprints. Click on the Actions drop-down in the top right-hand corner of the Platform Blueprint we want to view/edit and select Open. This will open the Platform Blueprint in the Platform Editor in view mode.\nTo create a new version of a Platform Blueprint, ensure the correct version of the Platform Blueprint is selected in the Control Bar then click on the Actions drop-down and select Save as new version (outlined in red below).\n     \n       \n     \nThis will open the New Platform Blueprint Version dialog. This will confirm the selected Platform Blueprint and version that we are going to base our new version on. \n     \n       \n     \nHere we need to specify the version number for our new Platform Blueprint. In addition, we can specify some notes that detail the reason for the new version. These notes will appear in the version history for any Platform Instance once updated to this version of the Platform Blueprint.\nOnce complete, click Save. This will create the new version of our Platform Blueprint and return us to the Platform Editor. Here we can see that the Control Bar displays the version (outlined in red below) of our new Platform Blueprint and that it has a status of DRAFT.\n     \n       \n     \nAdding a Data Source\nClick on Edit Configuration. In the tree view, search for jdbc and locate + icon next to JDBC Data Sources (outlined in red).\n     \n       \n     \nThis will open a modal dialog where you can enter the name of the data source as shown in the example below.\n     \n       \n     \nThe new data source should now be auto-selected and available for editing. We will see that initially none of its properties apart from the name have been set.\nAn alternative way of creating a new Data Source is to select an existing data source, right click on it and select clone.\n\n     \n       \n     \nNow fill out the remaining properties for the data source. MyST tries to provide as much guidance as possible by showing help (?) for each property and wherever applicable, restricting values that can be entered. For the purpose of our example, we will set the properties shown in the screen shot below.\n     \n       \n     \nIt's worth noting that we have used MyST properties to define the value of the User Name property. \n\nUser Name is set to ${[rxr.def.Product-rcu].param[db-user-prefix]}_STOCK\n\nClick the Calculate resolved values button on the component.  This will try to expand all the referenced properties (if possible) and show the final resolved values below the actual inputs. You should note that User Name is still left unresolved as ${[rxr.def.Product-rcu].param[db-user-prefix]}_STOCK. This is because the RCU prefix will be set in our Platform Models and is not available from the Blueprint.\n     \n       \n     \nFinally click Save & Commit.\nUpdate Platform Model\nCreate New Version of Platform Model\nFrom the side menu navigate to Modeling > Platform Models, this will display a list of existing Platform Models. Select the Platform Model to be updated. MyST will display summary details about the Platform Model and its corresponding Platform Instance. Click on the Actions drop-down in the top right-hand corner and select Configuration. This will open the Platform Model in the Platform Editor in view mode.\nBy default, MyST will open the Platform Model for the previous version of the Platform Blueprint. In the Control Bar select the Platform Blueprint version created in the previous step.\n     \n       \n     \nThe Platform Editor will highlight that there is no model currently defined for that version of the Platform Blueprint. Click Create (outlined above). \nThis will open the New Platform Model Version dialog. This will confirm the selected Platform Blueprint version that we are going to create our new Model for. Next, we need to select from the drop down an existing Platform Model we want to base our new model on. This is usually the most recent version.\nFinally provide some notes that detail the reason for the new version of the Platform Model.\n     \n       \n     \nOnce complete, click Save. This will create the new version of our Platform Model and return us to the Platform Editor. Here we can see that the Control Bar displays the version of our new Platform Model and that it has a status of DRAFT.\nVerify property resolution\nIn the tree view, search for the newly added data source (in our case, stock) and verify that it is available. Select it from the tree now.\nMyST will display it current configuration as defined in the Platform Blueprint. You should now see that User Name has been resolved to correctly (in our case to CI_STOCK), this is because the RCU prefix is set in our Platform model.\n     \n       \n     \nAdd environment specific details to our Platform Model\nClick on Edit Configuration. The data source should now be editable.\nThe only values we need to specify for our Data Source in the Platform Model are:\n\nDatabase URL - This is the URL for the database that we want our Data Source to connect to. \nPassword - This is the password for corresponding User Name for connecting to the database.\n\n\nNote: All stored passwords are first encrypted by MyST.\n\nEnter these values now similar to below\n     \n       \n     \nOnce done, click Save & Commit to save the Platform Model and commit our changes.\nPerforming a Dry Run\nWe are now ready to update our Platform Instance with its additional configuration. When we run a platform update, we have the option of specifying whether we first want to perform a dry run. \nWith a dry run, MyST doesn't perform the actual changes. Rather, it goes through the process of determining what changes need to be applied (in exactly the same way it does when making the actual changes) and then produces a report detailing the changes that will be made.\nThis allows us to quickly validate that the changes to be applied are as expected, and if not, go back and make the appropriate corrections to our Platform Blueprint and or Platform Model.\nFrom the side menu navigate toModeling > Platform Models, this will display a list of existing Platform Models. Select the Platform Model to be updated. MyST will display summary details about the Platform Model and its corresponding Platform Instance.\nWe can see that under Versions a list of Platform Model versions. Looking at the Instance Details we can see that the Platform Instance is currently on version1.0.0 of the Platform Blueprint \\ Model.\n     \n       \n     \nClick on the Actions drop-down and select Update, MyST will open the Platform Instance Update dialog.\n     \n       \n     \nFor the dropdown Update to Version select the new version of our Platform Model. By default, MyST will have that version of the model selected at which the instance is currently at (in this case 1.0.0[pr1][pm1]).\nNext, ensure the check-box Do a dry run has been selected. Lastly, enter any notes for this action and then click Update. MyST will initiate the Dry run and return us to the summary view of the Platform Model and Instance.\n     \n       \n     \nOnce the Dry run has completed, click on View Report (outlined above) under Actions. This will open a window showing the result of the Dry run, as shown below.\nThis will show details of all the changes that will be made when we execute an actual update.\n     \n       \n     \nPerform Platform Instance Update\nThe process for performing an update against the Platform Instance to apply the changes in our Platform Blueprint / Model is the same as performing a Dry run. Only this time ensure the check-box Do a dry run has not been selected.\nOnce we have initiated the update, MyST will return us to the summary view of the Platform Model and Instance where we should see the update in progress. Once completed, the Provisioned version under Instance Details will now show the new version of the Platform Model.\n     \n       \n     \nIf we click View Log under Actions this will open a dialog showing the execution log for the update, as shown below.\n     \n       \n     \nWhilst this example configuration change showed us adding a new data source, we would follow an identical approach if modifying an existing data source. In the latter case we would be updating an existing data source configuration in the Platform Blueprint. MyST will determine and perform the required steps to apply the necessary changes.\n\nSee Platform Configuration for details on how define other configuration requirements within a Platform Blueprint / Model.\n"},"platform/definitions/":{"url":"platform/definitions/","title":"Maintaining Platform Definitions","keywords":"","body":"Maintaining Platform Definitions\nWithin MyST, the target state of each Platform Instance is captured in the “platform definition”, which is divided into two layers: \n\nFirst, the Platform Blueprint defines an environment agnostic specification used to define the platform topology and configuration of your Oracle Middleware. \nSecond, the Platform Model overlays the environment specific configurations. \n\nThis “platform definition” is used to manage the entire platform lifecycle from provisioning the initial platform instance through to managing on-going configuration changes.\nThis means incremental configuration changes are simple\n to make and propagate across all environments. Users just\n update the target state in the Platform Blueprint / Model and then deploy these changes as required against the Platform Instance. MyST will determine and\n perform the required steps to apply the necessary changes.\nThis declarative approach to defining target state enables MyST to treat Oracle Middleware infrastructure as code. Platform Blueprints and Models are put under version control, allowing us to easily propose, review, test, promote and deploy configuration changes.\nTo learn how to create a Platform Blueprints and Models can be Version Controlled it is recommended to follow the guide:\n\nUnderstanding Platform Blueprint and Model Version Control\n\nTo learn how to edit configuration for Platform Blueprints and Models it is recommended to follow the guide:\n\nEditing Platform Blueprints and Models\n\n"},"platform/definitions/version-control/":{"url":"platform/definitions/version-control/","title":"Platform Version Control","keywords":"","body":"Platform Version Control\nWithin MyST, Platform Blueprints and Models are put under version control, allowing us to easily propose, review, test, promote and deploy configuration changes. \nPlatform Blueprint Versions\nOver the Platform Lifecycle we can have multiple versions of a Platform Blueprint, though we would typically have a maximum of two versions under development at any point in time, one for main development (like a trunk in version control) and another one optionally for patches (like a production fix branch in version control).\nWe can make multiple revisions to a version of a Platform Blueprint. Although not mandated by MyST, it is expected that we would work on a single version of a Platform Blueprint until it gets promoted to Production, at which point we would set its state to FINAL and start working on a newer version.\nWhen working on a new revision, the revision is initially in a DRAFT state. Whilst in a draft state, MyST allows us to save configuration in draft form repeatedly, overwriting the previous draft, without actually committing or applying them to any Platform Instance. \nOnce we are happy with our changes, MyST allows us to explicitly commit the revision permanently to source control (which can then be applied to a Platform Instance). If we make any subsequent changes, then MyST will automatically create a newer revision.\nMyST allows us to go back to any previously committed revision.\n\nIn MyST, a platform blueprint version obeys the naming convention, 1.0.0[pr3]. Here, 1.0.0 is the version of the blueprint, pr is the standard prefix for a platform blueprint revision and 3 is the current revision number for it.\nPlatform Model Versions\nFor each Platform Instance that we want to create, we need to create a corresponding Platform Model in MyST. For example, if we wanted to create DEV, TST, and PROD environments, we would create three Platform Models.\nFor each version of a Platform Blueprint, we can have exactly one version of each Platform Model associated with it. Remember, the Platform Model is meant to track environment specific changes to the configuration over time (passwords, endpoints, memory settings, etc). Changes to this configuration can also be independently tracked through revisions, which again can be in draft state and then subsequently in committed state for them to become eligible for applying to the target environment.\nIn MyST, a Platform Model version obeys the naming convention, 1.0.0[pr3][pm4]. Here, 1.0.0[pr3] just refers to the Platform Blueprint version and its current revision, pm is the standard prefix for a Platform Model revision and 4 is the current revision number for it.\nPlease note that the Platform Model can be revised independently of revisions to the Platform Blueprint and there is no hard relationship between them. The association exists between the Platform Model version and the Platform Blueprint version while the revisions evolve independently.\nDraft, Committed and Final States\nPlatform Blueprint and Models in MyST can be in one of three states:\n\nDraft - Means that the current revision of the Platform Blueprint / Model version being viewed is still in a draft state and is not committed, hence will not be acted upon by a release pipeline (see below). It also implies that this revision cannot be applied to any environments (unless they allow drafts which is an exception rather than the rule).\n\nCommitted - Means that the current revision of the Platform Blueprint / Model version being viewed has been committed, hence will be acted upon by a release pipeline if configured to do so. It also implies, in the case of a Platform Blueprint, that this revision can be applied to all environments. Any subsequent changes will automatically be saved in a new revision.\n\nFinal - Means that the current version of the Platform Blueprint / Model being viewed is finalized (most likely because it has been promoted all the way to production). Any subsequent changes to configuration will have to be made in a new version.\n\n\nPlatform Blueprint Development Lifecycle\nSince MyST allows us to treat configuration as code, it allows us to follow a similar process when promoting platform configurations from development through our staging environments and into Production.\nPlatform Blueprint Development\nBy default, Platform Blueprint / Model revisions in a draft state cannot be applied to any environment. This is to prevent unfinished changes from accidentally being applied. \nHowever, when developing the initial Platform Blueprint or if making a significant change then the blueprint developer may want to frequently save and test their changes in a DEV or SANDBOX environment, without wanting to commit these changes each time.\nTo support this scenario, MyST allows us to configure an Environment Type as allowing draft revisions to be applied.\nPlatform Instances with an environment type that allows provisioning / updating of draft configuration cannot be used in a Release Pipeline.\n\nPromoting Platform Blueprints\nOnce a revision to a Platform Blueprint has been committed, we will typically want to promote this to our first staging environment, validate and test it in that environment and, once passed, promote it to the next staging environment and so on.\nIf at any stage, the Platform Blueprint fails validation, we would update the Platform Blueprint to fix the issue and commit the change to version control. We would then re-start the process of promoting the latest revision of our Platform Blueprint through each of our staging environments until the Platform Blueprint is successfully promoted into Production.\nMyST supports two methods for promoting Platform Blueprints through each environment:\n\nManual - Users manually trigger MyST to update a Platform Instance to a new version/revision of a Platform Blueprint / Model (see Updating Instances for more details). With this approach, the user is responsible for managing the promotion process.\nRelease Pipeline - A Release Pipeline can be used for managing the process of promoting a new version / revision of a Platform Blueprint through each staging environment and into production.\n\nImplementing Continuous Integration / Delivery for Platform Configuration\nRelease Pipelines allow us to implement a continuous integration/delivery process for promoting platform configuration changes.\nAs a first step towards continuous delivery, one normally would set up a continuous integration server and a CI environment where code gets deployed to every time a commit happens. \nSimilarly, every configuration change can be and should be applied continuously to a CI environment on a commit. For this, MyST plays the role of a CI server for configuration where it tracks committed Platform Blueprint changes and then applies these changes to the target CI environment.\nOnce applied, MyST can trigger an automated test to validate the configuration changes, in a similar way that we would when deploying code. \nOnce a particular revision of a Platform Blueprint has been successfully promoted to CI, then we can use the Release Pipeline to promote the change to the next staging environment and so on. For each stage, we can define whether MyST automatically promotes the Platform Blueprint or whether it needs to be manually approved. \nThe Release Pipeline allows us to track the promotion of committed changes through each stage, providing the visibility as to what version/revision of a Platform Blueprint is currently deployed in each staging environment.\nMyST allows us to combine the promotion of code and configuration into a release pipeline. \nFor more details on how to configure a release pipeline see Release Pipelines.\nTying it all together - An example\nWe have a platform blueprint, SOA 12.2.1.0.0, having one version, 1.0.0 and the latest revision of 1 in COMMITTED state, i.e. 1.0.0[pr1].\n     \n       \n     \nWe have 5 environments, CI, SIT, UAT, PREPROD and PROD, all of which do not allow draft configuration to be provisioned/applied to them (default behavior)\n     \n       \n     \nWe have 5 Platform Models for the above Platform Blueprint, one for each of the 5 environments. All of them have only 1 revision for the 1.0.0 blueprint version in COMMITTED state, i.e. [pm1] which when combined with the Platform Blueprint would read as 1.0.0[pr1][pm1].\n     \n       \n     \nWe have an active release pipeline, DEFAULT_DEV_PIPELINE, tracking configuration changes through the 5 environments above.\n     \n       \n     \nAs can be seen from above the CI and SIT stages are already provisioned while the UAT stage is pending approval.\nNow make any change to the Platform Blueprint and save it.

It groups components logically and allows us to easily search and traverse through the top level confiuration elements as well as add and remove elements from it.\n     \n       \n     \nThe different parts of the tree user interface are numbered in the image above. We will now explain what they mean and how each one can be used.\n\nSearch Bar - This can be used to type and search for components within the tree. Once we start typing text, the matching components will get filtered out and the search text will be highlighted in yellow for each one of them.\n     \n       \n     \nSee how when typing jdb, only JDBC Data Sources and JDBC Stores get shown and the search text jdb is highlighted for each one of them. Also note, how the parent nodes of the matched ones get auto-expanded. In this example see how Persistent Stores got auto-expanded to reveal JDBC Stores.\n The node expansion when we type in text is just temporary. If we clear the search text, we will notice how the tree gets restored back to the state where it was originally at. As in, it would show the nodes in collapsed or expanded state based on how we had originally clicked them. \n\n\nSelected Node - Nodes in the tree could either be actual configuration elements or just logical categories for ease of visualization. Only actual configuration elements are selectable. When we click on any such node, it gets highlighted in bold with a black outline and the Properties View displays properties specific to that node.\n\nThe browser URL at this stage can also be bookmarked in you case we want to open this view directly with the same component pre-selected. \n\n\nComputed Configuration - Any component shown in a green background represents something which MyST has automatically computed and that which the user has not explicitly defined / overriden. For example, in the image, the AdminServer node has been auto-computed by MyST based on the other user-defined inputs.\n\nAdd New Component - For any component types which are collections, e.g. JDBC Data Sources, WebLogic clusters etc. and that which are editable, MyST provides us with this + control which when clicked can add a new component of that type. In the image above, when we click on the + button, MyST will prompt us with a modal dialog to capture the WebLogic cluster name and based on that will add a new cluster to the model and select it.\n\nContext Menu - For any components which are collections, e.g. JDBC Data Sources, MyST provides us with a context menu to take certain actions. These actions include Remove to remove the component from the model and Clone to create a similar component based on the current one.\n\nCategories - These are just logical grouping of similar configuration and themselves do not represent any configuration elements. For example, in the image above, Startup & Shutdown Classes is just a group which consists of the configuration of individual startup and shutdown classes within it.\n\nExpanding / Collapsing - Clicking on the plus sign (+) of a node will expand it to show any child components and make it collapsible by revealing the minus sign (-). Needless to say, clicking this will collapse the component and hide the child components. \n\n\nAt the top level, platform configuration consists of the following components:\n\nGlobal Variables - List of zero, one or more key-value pairs which could represent simple variables or in some cases flags and even full-blown configuration elements.\nMiddleware Settings - The high level Fusion middleware configuration such as the the middleware version, the middleware home directory, etc.\nProducts - The core products that make up the platform, such as Java, WebLogic, Oracle SOA Suite, etc.\nCompute Groups - The heteregenous grouping of compute nodes. It is assumed that each node in a group will have similar confiugration.\nCompute Nodes - The physical or virtual machines that host the platform. These are mapped to the actual hosts from the infrastructure provider.\nWebLogic Domain Configuration - The entire configuration of the WebLogic domain. Typically, the elements here are what we end up configuring inside WebLogic through the admin console.\nWebTier Configuration - The Oracle HTTP Server configuration in case it has been selected as a product. This would include module config file locations, virtual host definition, routing rules, etc.\nLoad Balancer Configuration - In case a load balancer is present, this just represents a list of frontend definitions which can be referenced by other components such as managed servers, etc.\nJava KeyStores - Reusable definitions for Java keystores (JKS files) which can be referenced by managed servers, node managers, etc. for specifying their SSL requirements (identity, trust, etc.)\nSystem Artifacts - Artifacts which are deployed as part of the platform provisioning lifecycle. Examples include any custom SQL scripts to run one-off, any libraries to be copied into the WebLogic domain directory, etc. Typically these represent those artifacts which may well be considered a part of the platform itself rather than being separately handled through release management.\n\n"},"platform/definitions/editor/properties-view/":{"url":"platform/definitions/editor/properties-view/","title":"Properties View","keywords":"","body":"Properties View\nThe Properties View displays the list of properties and corresponding values defined for the selected component in the Tree View. It allows one to view as well as change configuration for individual attributes of a component.\nThese attributes may just be simple types such as text values, numbers, enumerations, etc. but can also themselves be quite complex structures such as lists and maps.\nThe view changes significantly based on whether it is seen in view mode or edit mode. Hence, each of these modes and the constructs within them are described in separate sections below.\nView Mode\nThe view mode is for viewing the properties and their values. It only shows those properties whose values have been set and not the entire set of properties that are available for the component being viewed.\n     \n       \n     \nThe different components of the property view are numbered in the image above. We will now explain what they mean and how each one can be used.\n\nComponent Title - This is a read-only title for the component which quickly helps us understand what it is. It normally consists of the name of the component and the type of it. \nIn case there can be only one component of a particular type, the name attribute is omitted and only the type of the component is displayed which is sufficient to explain what it is.\nAbove, we can see that the component is a JDBC Data Source with name StockDS.\n\nComponent Help - On clicking on the component title, a popover is shown providing contextual help about it. This can help those who have previously not worked with this component in terms of understanding what it represents and how they can use it. \n\nAdvanced Mode - A switch which if turned on, will display those properties which are earmarked as advanced. Advanced properties are those which normally are not shown to the user as most often they would not be configuring these.\nSo, having the switch set to off would show lesser configuration to the user and hence reduces visual noise by hiding the lesser used properties.\n\nOnce the switch is turned on, MyST remembers the setting for the current session and it will continue to stay on even when the user navigates to other components.\n\n\nAuto-Computed Properties - Any property value shown in a green background represents something which MyST has automatically computed and that which the user has not explicitly defined / overriden. For example, in the image, the type of the data source is auto-computed by MyST as Generic.\nThe way MyST does this computation is based on various aspects. The most common among these is to rely on the basic information supplied by the user and guessing other configuration based on it. Other aspects include compliance with the Oracle Enterprise Deployment Guide, best practices learnt over time by working with different customer environments, etc.\n All other properties whose values are shown in white represent user-defined properties. These also include those where MyST had computed an initial value but the the user chose to override it with his own value.\n\n\nResolved Values - When viewing properties, MyST shows the resolved value for it. If we hover over the value we will also see something called the raw value for the property. MyST only persists the raw value and while displaying shows the resolved value. \n     \n       \n     \nIn most cases, the resolved value and the raw value will be identical. However, the instances where these will be different are:\n a. When we have defined the original value using property references. In such cases, MyST expands the references and show the final value after expansion as the resolved value. Property references are explained in more depth here.\n b. Boolean fields, drop-downs etc. In such cases, it is possible that the value shown as resolved value is just a display label whereas the raw value is the actual key. e.g. Yes might be shown as the resolved value whereas the actual raw value might be true. \n\nProperty Help - Clicking on the question-mark sign (?) besides each property name shows a popover containing helpful information about it. \n     \n       \n     \nThis can help those who have previously not worked with this property in terms of understanding what it represents and how they can use / specify it.\n\n\nEdit Mode\nThe edit mode is for editing the properties and their values. It shows the entire set of properties that are available for the component being edited and guides us so that we can enter suitable values for each one of them.\n     \n       \n     \nThe different components of the property view in edit mode are numbered in the image above. We will now explain what they mean and how each one can be used. Note that the ones we already covered while describing the view mode are omitted here.\n\nSimple Textual Property - The most basic form of capturing value for a property is by providing a simple text box. We just type in the desired value for out property into this box as shown in the image. These properties can be further split into three variations.\nA variation of this is the number property which shows a text box restricted to typing in integer values. \n\nRelationship Property - Often, we need to establish relationships between different components. The relationships could be one-to-one or one-to-many. In MyST, these relationships are also captured through property values.\nAs shown in the image, here a JDBC Data Source has to specify the WebLogic clusters / servers where it needs to be targeted to. For this, it has a Targets property which presents a multi-select drop-down of clusters and servers based on the configuration and we have chosen soa_cluster from the available options.\n     \n       \n     \n\nEnum Property - Many properties are restricted to a limited set of allowed values. For this, MyST has enum properties which allows us to choose from a pre-defined list of options.\nAn often used form of this is the boolean property which shows a simple dropdown with Yes and No options which when chosen results in MyST storing either true or false as the property value.\n     \n       \n     \n\nPassword Property - As suggested by the name, these are properties whose values are sensitive and hence are captured as password fields. MyST stores values for such properties in an encrypted format.\n\nKey-Value Property - These properties allow us to specify values in a map like format where we can define multiple keys and their corresponding values. \n     \n       \n     \nTo add a new key, we should click on the + button. This will add a new row and allow us to fill in values for both the key and its corresponding value.\nWe can also delete already added key-value pairs using the Delete button against each of them.\nSometimes, it is more convenient to edit these key-value pairs in bulk when the number of such pairs is high or when we need to easily copy and paste from a properties file for example. To allow this, we can click on the green Bulk Edit button which will switch the editor into a text-area view such as below\n     \n       \n     \nAfter making all changes inside this text-area, we should click on Done and we will be taken back to the original mode. \n\nCalculate Resolved Values - By default, MyST wont show the resolved values for every property. To display the resolved values at any time, we can click on the Calculate resolved values button. This will result in all resolved values showing up below the input values. \n     \n       \n     \nIn this context, resolved value means the final value that is going to be used by MyST when it configures the platform.\nIn the image above, the data source type Generic resolves to generic in lower case as this is the actual value that MyST is going to use while configuring the data source.\nAnother example is where the value has property references. In the image above, the database user property had a property reference ${[rxr.def.Product-rcu].param[db-user-prefix]} which resolved to the value, CI, hence resulting in the value CI_STOCK. As before, this indicate that CI_STOCK is the value that is going to be used by MyST when it configures the data source.\n\nComplex Properties - As we told earlier, properties need not always be only simple types. Just as we saw examples of mapstyle properties, we can also have object and list style properties.\nIn the image above, Driver Parameters is an object style property which has other sub-properties within it.\n     \n       \n     \nThe image above is an example of a list style property. We can add items onto the list with an identifier for each of them. Each item in a list is itself an object style property which can again contain sub-properties as before.\n\nNote that complex properties can be at any level of depth.\n\n\nMandatory Properties - For every component, there may be some properties which are mandatory and whose values have to be filled in before committing.\n     \n       \n     \nIf a mandatory property is left empty, MyST will show a validation error below it. However, MyST wont actually stop us from saving the configuration.\nThis is because there might be instances where one wants to just save draft configuration without actually committing it and to allow for this, MyST prompts us but still allows to save.\n Currently MyST does not do any mandatory property validations on a commit. In future, MyST may do validation of such configuration and prompt the user to fill in the values for all the missing properties.\n\n\nProperty Help - This is exactly same as described for the view mode with an exception. Here, the popover not only shows help text for the property but also shows an expression which can be used to reference the property in other places.\n     \n       \n     \nIn the image above, we can notice the Expression for the property. Using the copy button (outlined in red), we can also easily copy this expression to clipboard and then paste it wherever we need to reference it. To understand more about property references, see Using Property References\n\nRaw Mode Switch - This allows us to toggle between the displayed value / options and the actual raw value that MyST will store. This may prove to be quite useful in cases where we feel that the options MyST has presented are inadequate or in cases where we may want to use property references instead of choosing from the options.\n     \n       \n     \n     \n       \n     \nSee above how when the Raw switch is turned on, MyST shows a text box with the actual raw value, generic instead of the display label Generic. We can now go ahead and change this to any value we want, irrespective of whether or not it is a part of the allowed options.\n     \n       \n     \nIn cases where we have entered a raw value which does not match any of the provided options and we wish to turn the Raw mode off, MyST will prompt us with a message asking us to decide whether we want to reset our value to what it was before or just stay on in the Raw mode.\nThis is to prevent us from accidentally switching the Raw mode off and losing what we explictly entered as the value. It is a conscious choice that has to be made by us.\nRelationships - For relationships, MyST automatically tries to use property references as the raw value.\n     \n       \n     \n     \n       \n     \nSee how in the example above, MyST tries to keep a property reference as the raw value instead of the literal value, soa_cluster.\nThis is because even if someone goes ahead and changes the name of the cluster in future, the property value here would reflect the new name automatically rather than breaking the established relationship.\n\n\n"},"platform/definitions/editor/topology-view/":{"url":"platform/definitions/editor/topology-view/","title":"Topology View","keywords":"","body":"Topology View\nThe Topology View presents a visual representation of the physical topology of the platform.

This section goes a bit deeper into understanding the syntax of these property references.\nNot for Beginners\nFor all practical purpose, the expressions that MyST allows us to copy for each property should suffice and one never would really need to know how to use the references, so this section is intended for more advanced users and can be entirely skipped by those who are just getting started with MyST\n\nProperty Expansion\nTo make editing and maintenance of Platform Blueprints easier, MyST supports property expansion when defining the value of a property. This allows us to define the value of a property based on the value of one or more other properties.\nWhen a string of the format ${some.property} appears in a property value it will be expanded to the value of the specified property.\nFor example, if we have the following properties:\n\noracle.base - Defines the Oracle Home directory for installing the Oracle Middleware Platform. \noui.inventory.directory - Defines the Oracle Universal Installer (OUI) Inventory Directory\n\nThe default location for (OUI) Inventory Directory is to place this in the sub-directory oraInventory under the Oracle Home. MyST enables us to set the value of the property oui.inventory.directory to  ${var.oracle.base}/oraInventory.\nReferencing MyST Properties\nWhen referencing a MyST property, in order to uniquely identify it, we need to specify the full path of the property within the Platform Blueprint or Model.\nThe simplest way to derive the expression to reference a property is to locate the property we wish to reference within the Property Viewer and click on the ? against the Property Name. MyST will open a popover containing the expression to reference the property as shown below.\n     \n       \n     \nWe can use the copy to clipboard icon (outlined above) to easily copy the property expression and then paste it wherever we need to reference it.\nThe Platform Editor needs to be in Edit mode in order to be able to view a property reference expression.\n\nUnderstand the MyST Property Path\nIn general, a dot notation is used to traverse the property hierarchy. For example, a.b.c would mean locate c within b within a. \nReferencing a property value within a component\nA component is a complex type consisting of a pre-defined collection of object types. To reference a property value within a component we used the following syntax:\n[].\nWhere\n\n - Is the path to the component containing the property.\n - Is the key for the property whose value we are referencing within the component.\n\nFor example, within a Platform Blueprint or Model, we have the Middleware Settings component, to reference the version property value, we would use the expression: \n${[rxr.wls.Fmw-1].version}\nIn this example:\n\nrxr.wls.Fmw-1 is the  as defined in the table.\nversion is the .\n\nReferencing a child component within a parent component\nReference a child component within a parent component we use the following syntax:\n.\nWhere:  \n\n - Is the path to the component containing the child component.\n - Is the key for the component that we are referencing within the parent component.\n\nReferencing a component within a list\nA list is a complex type consisting of a list of zero, one or more components of the same type. \nTo reference a component within a list we use the following syntax:\n[.-]\nWhere\n\n - Is the path to the component containing the list.\n - Is the component type held in the list\n - Is the key for the component that we are referencing within the list. \n\nFor example, a Platform Blueprint contains a list of Products (for example Java, SOA, Service Bus, RCU) that will be installed. In this example, if we want to reference the RCU component, we would use the expression:\n[rxr.def.Product-rcu]\nWhere\n\n is rxr.def as defined in the xxxx table.\nProduct is the .\nrcu is the  for the RCU product component in the list \n\nTo reference the RCU product version we would use the expression:   \n${[rxr.def.Product-rcu].version}\nFor many lists, the component key defaults to the index number of the object stored in the list. For example, a WebLogic Domain contains a list of WebLogic Clusters. In this example: \n\nThe WebLogic Domain is the object containing the list. So  is rxr.wls\nCluster is the component type stored in the list.\n1 is the component key for the first cluster, 2 the component key for the second cluster, and so on.\n\nThus the component property path to the second cluster in the list would be expressed as [rxr.wls.Cluster-2]. To reference the cluster name we would use the expression:${[rxr.wls.Cluster-2].name}\nReferencing a property value within a property of type map\nAs we mentioned earlier, a component is a complex type consisting of a pre-defined collection of object types. However, we often want to add additional properties to a component, that aren't defined in advance. \nWe can do this using a map. A map is a list of zero, one or more property types. The list of properties is not fixed and can be added to on the fly using the Platform Editor.\nTo reference a property value within amap we use the following syntax:\n.param[]\nWhere\n\n - Is the path to the component containing the map\n - Is the key for the property stored in the paramList\n\nFor example, the Oracle SOA Suite Product object contains a Configuration Parameters map, that contains a number of string properties, such as audit-level and base-port. To reference the base-port value we would use the expression:  \n${[rxr.def.Product-soa].param[base-port]}\nReferencing a Global Variable value\nMyST supports the notion of global variables. These are essentially held as a key-value map. To reference a global property value within a component we used the following syntax:  \n${.}\nwhere\n\n - Is the path to the component containing the property.  \n - Is the key for the property whose value we are referencing within the component.\n\nFor example, to reference the value of global variable install.directory, we would use the expression:\n${var.install.directory}\n"},"platform/management/":{"url":"platform/management/","title":"Managing Platform Instances","keywords":"","body":"Managing Platform Instances\nIn this section we detail how to use MyST to perform common platform administration tasks, including how to:\n\nView a Platform Instance Configuration\nReport on a Platform Instance\nStart, Stop and Restart a Platform Instance\nCheck for and Correct Configuration Drift\nTerminate and Re-Provision a Platform Instance\nPatch a Platform Instance\nOverride the state of a Platform Instance\n\nIn addition, we also cover the mechanism MyST uses to queue actions against a Platform Instance as well as how to view the Action History and current Pending Actions.\nAll of these activities are performed from the Platform Instance Summary window. We can access this from the side menu by navigating toProvisioning > Platform Instances. This will display a list of existing Platform Instances. \n     \n       \n     \nSelect the corresponding Platform Instance (outlined in red above), MyST will display summary information about the state of the Platform Model and Instance Details as shown below.\n     \n       \n     \nThe Platform Instance Summary is broken into three sections; General Information, Versions and Instance Details. Each section provides key information about the Platform Instance as detailed below.\nThe General Information section provides the following information:\n\nName - This is the name of the Platform Instance as defined by the Platform Blueprint\n\nDescription - This is the description of the Platform Instance as defined by the Platform Model\n\n\nThe Versions section lists each version of the Platform Blueprint, for each version of the Platform Blueprint it provides the following information:\n\nVersion This shows the latest revision of the Platform Blueprint and Platform Model.\n\nBlueprint Status - The status of the latest revision of the Platform Blueprint, this can be Draft, Committed or Final.\n\nModel Status - The status of the latest revision of the Platform Model, this can be Draft, Committed or Final.\n\nNotes - The Platform Model Version Notes.\n\n\nThe Instance Details section provides the following information:\n\nProvisioned Version - This is the current version of the Platform Instance.\n\n\nInstance State - This shows the current state of the Platform Instance. It can be one of:\nActive\nProvisioning In Progress\nProvisioning Failed\nTermination In Progress\nTerminated\nTermination Failed\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Action - This shows details of the current action being performed (or the last action if completed). This includes:\nDescription - This is the action being performed, for example, Provisioning, Start, Stop, etc.\nStatus - Which could be In Progress, Success or Failed\nExecution time - The start and stop time of the action\nAction(s) - Actions that can be taken here. These include ability to view and download execution logs, download support artifacts in event of failure, viewing drift and dry run reports.\n\n\n\nClicking on Pending action(s) will show the list of currently queued actions, whilst clicking on Action History will show us the list of actions performed against the Platform Instance till date.\nThe Actions drop-down allows us to select and perform the various management activities against the Platform Instance.\nView Platform Instance Configuration\nMyST allows us to view the current configuration of each of our Platform Instances. From within the Platform Instance Summary window, click on the Actions drop-down and select View Configuration. \n     \n       \n     \nMyST will open the Platform Instance in the Platform Viewer. From here we can browse the full configuration of the Platform Instance.\n     \n       \n     \nIn the initial view, we can see key information about the instance as well as important service URLs such as the Admin Console, Enterprise Manager Console, Service Bus Console.\nThe rest of the configuration of the instance can be browsed through and navigated as we have previously seen here. Please go through that section for more details on how to navigate and access the configuration of the platform.\nFor example, to view the physical topology of the platform, we can click on the Topology tab which will show us a topology diagram such as below.\n     \n       \n     \nPlatform Instance Report\nThe Platform instance report provides a summary report of all the key configuration information for our Platform Instance.\nTo access this select the corresponding Platform Instance, then click on the Actions menu and select View Report, MyST will open the Platform Instance Report as shown below.\n     \n       \n     \n\nNote: By clicking on the header for each section, we can close and expand that part of the report as required.\n\nStart, Stop and Restarting Platform Instance\nMyST allows us to easily Start, Stop and Restart Platform Instances. When performing these actions, we can choose to perform these actions against the entire cluster or we can choose to perform the action on specific nodes within the cluster.\nStopping a Platform Instance\nFrom within the Platform Instance Summary window, click on the Actions drop-down and select Control, MyST will open the Platform Instance Control dialog.\n     \n       \n     \nSelect Stop as the action to perform (outlined in red above). By default, MyST will apply this action to all nodes within the cluster. If we only want to stop specific nodes, then first remove the nodes that we don't want to perform this action on.\nEnter any notes as to why we are performing the action and click Execute.\nMyST will queue the action in the list of Pending Actions for the Platform Instance and, when ready, will proceed to stop the Platform Instance.\n     \n       \n     \nStarting a Platform Instance\nTo start a Platform Instance we follow the same process for stopping a Platform Instance, but select Start as the action to perform.\nRestarting a Platform Instance\nTo restart a Platform Instance we follow the same process for stopping a Platform Instance, but select Restart as the action to perform.\nCheck for and Correct Configuration Drift\nConfiguration drift is caused by inconsistent configuration across different environments. Configuration drift occurs naturally in data center environments due to manual adhoc changes.\nMyST's approach to managing incremental change allows us to define, test, promote and track configuration changes across all environments and thus prevent configuration drift from occurring.\nHowever, this does not stop someone from directly using the WebLogic console to perform manual changes. When this occurs, we want the ability to detect such a change, and then either use MyST to restore the Platform Instance to its correct state or alternatively if the change is required, to incorporate the change into the Platform Blueprint so it can be applied consistently across all environments.\nNote: Many MyST users restrict their users from making configuration changes via the WebLogic console to prevent these scenarios' from occurring.\nCheck for Drift\nMyST's Check for Drift capability allows us to check the configuration of the Platform Instance as defined by its Platform Blueprint / Model against the actual WebLogic domain and report on differences.\nFrom within the Platform Instance Summary window, click on the Actions drop-down and select Check for Drift, MyST will initiate the check for drift process.\n     \n       \n     \nOnce completed, click on the View Report icon (outlined in red above). MyST will display a complete drift report as below.\n     \n       \n     \nIn the above report, we can see that the value of the property MaxCapacity has drifted to 100. \nReset Drift\nFrom within the Platform Instance Summary window, click on the Actions drop-down and select Control, MyST will open the Platform Instance Control dialog.\n     \n       \n     \nSelect Reset Drift as the action to perform (outlined in red above) add any Action Notes and click Execute. MyST will queue the Reset Drift action for execution and return us to the summary view of the Platform Model and Instance.\nOnce the Reset Drift action has completed, click on the View Log icon under the Current Action -> Action(s). This will open a dialog showing the result of the Drift, as shown below.\n     \n       \n     \nThis will show details of all the changes made to correct any configuration drift. We can see from the log (outlined above) that MyST has reset the MaxCapacity property on the StockDS Data Source.\nTerminate and Re-Provision a Platform Instance\nMyST allows us to terminate and re-provision our Platform Instances. This can be useful for a number of reasons:\n\nReset a Platform Instance to a previous known state, for example, re-provision the Platform Instance based on an earlier version of the Platform Blueprint.\nTemporarily re-purpose the infrastructure, knowing we can re-provision the platform instance when required at a future date.\nRe-provision corrupted environment, for example, if we suspect the underlying file system has been corrupted, we can re-provision the platform instance.\n\nTerminate a Platform Instance\nFrom within the Platform Instance Summary window, click on the Actions drop-down and select Terminate, MyST will open the Terminate Platform Instance dialog and prompt for confirmation to proceed.\n     \n       \n     \nClick OK. MyST will queue the Terminate action for execution and return us to the summary view of the Platform Model and Instance.\n     \n       \n     \nOnce terminated the status of the Platform Instance will be updated to TERMINATED and the Instance Details will indicate Instance Not Provisioned.\n     \n       \n     \nEven though the Platform Instance has been terminated, we still have access to the Action History of the terminated instance.\nTerminate AWS On-Demand\nWhen terminating a Platform Instance running on infrastructure of type AWS On-Demand, MyST will also provide you with the option of terminating the AWS Instances\n     \n       \n     \nIf we select this option, MyST will terminate the AWS EC2 instances that were provisioned on-demand when the original Platform Instance was provisioned.\nRe-Provisioning a Terminated Platform Instance\nMyST allows us to re-provision any previously terminated Platform Instance. \nFrom the side menu navigate to Modeling > Platform Models, this will display a list of existing Platform Models. \nTo re-provision a terminated Platform Instance, select the corresponding Platform Model, MyST will display the Platform Model and Instance summary. Click on the Actions menu and select Reprovision.\nMyST will open the New Platform Instance dialog. Here we can select which version of the Platform Instance we want to re-provision. Here, you get access to the following controls\n     \n       \n     \n\nVersion - Here, we can select the exact version of the platform blueprint and the exact revisions of the blueprint and model that we want to reprovision. By default, the latest and version and revisions will be pre-selected.\nEnvironment already pre-provisioned? - Selecting this indicated to MyST that the instance is already provisioning and running. So, MyST will just do some connectivity checks and not actually kick off provisioning of the instance in case this option is checked.\nAuto-deploy applications? - MyST keeps tracks of artifact deployments that were made over time to a platform instance. If we select this option, MyST will try to auto-deploy those artifacts once more to the instance to bring it to the same state as it was before termination.\nProvisioning Notes - Any comments to indicate why we are reprovisioning the instance.\n\nOnce done, click Finish. MyST will queue the Reprovision action for execution and return us to the summary view of the Platform Model and Instance.\nPatching a Platform Instance\nMyST allows us to easily patch a Platform Instance. When performing these actions, we can choose to perform these actions against the entire cluster or we can choose to perform the action on specific nodes within the cluster.\nBefore applying a patch to a Platform Instance, we must first add the patches to the Platform Blueprint - see Oracle Patches for further details.\nFrom within the Platform Instance Summary window, click on the Actions drop-down and select Control, MyST will open the Platform Instance Control dialog.\n     \n       \n     \nSelect Patch as the action to perform (outlined in red above). By default, MyST will apply this action to all nodes within the cluster. If we only want to patch specific nodes, then first remove the nodes that we don't want to perform this action on.\nSpecify whether a server restart is required to apply the patch, then enter any notes as to why we are performing the action and click Execute.\nMyST will queue the action in the list of Pending Actions for the Platform Instance and when ready proceed to patch the Platform Instance.\n     \n       \n     \nAborting the Current Action\nThere might be cases where an action is running for a long time and we would want to abort it for various reasons. MyST allows us to abort an current running action on a best-effort basis.\n     \n       \n     \nLocate the Abort button as shown above and click on it. MyST will show a confirmation dialog like below and once we give a go-ahead, the action will be aborted.\n     \n       \n     \n     \n       \n     \nAlternatively, if we restart MyST Studio, we will see that the action and the instance state will automatically go into a state of INDETERMINATE and the user then has to manually override the state of the instance to reflect the correct state. See below on how to override the state of an instance.\nOverriding the State of a Platform Instance\nMyST allows us to override the state of an instance in case we want to intervene and do manual reconciliation.\nThis has to be done with extreme caution by users who have advanced privileges as this could have significant impact on the internal workflow for the instance and cause subsequent actions to get stalled\n\nFrom the side menu navigate to Modeling > Platform Models, this will display a list of existing Platform Models. \nTo override the state of the Platform Instance, select the corresponding Platform Model, MyST will display the Platform Model and Instance summary. Click on the Actions menu and select Override State.\nMyST will open the Platform Instance State Override dialog. Here we can see the current state of the instance and change it to be in a new state. MyST will just assume that the user knows what he is doing and internall record this as the new state of the instance and do all subsequent action on this instance obeying this.\n     \n       \n     \n"},"platform/introspection/":{"url":"platform/introspection/","title":"Introspecting Existing Platform Instances","keywords":"","body":"Introspecting Existing Platform Instances\nMyST allows us to create a Platform Blueprint based on an existing WebLogic Domain, we simply point MyST at an existing WebLogic Domain, MyST will introspect the platform instance and create a corresponding Platform Blueprint. MyST also provides the option to create a corresponding Platform Model.\nThis supports a number of use cases, including:\n\nSide-By-Side Upgrade - We can introspect an existing 11g environment, extract the key configuration information and then use this to automatically provision an equivalent 12c environment in minutes.\n\nLift and Shift to the Cloud - We can introspect an existing 11g/12c environment and then use MyST to provision an equivalent environment to the cloud.\n\nManage Existing Platform Instance - When introspecting a Platform instance, we have the option of creating a Platform Model for the introspected WebLogic Domain, we can then use MyST to manage on-going configuration changes and code deployments to the introspected platform.\n\nReplicate PROD Environment - We can introspect an existing 11g/12c environment, for example Production, and then use this to provision equivalent non-prod environments (e.g. DEV, SIT, UAT, PRE), and thus quickly ensure that all environments are identically configured and eliminate configuration drift.\n\n\nThe end-to-end process consists of three simple steps and can be performed in minutes.\nStep 1. Identify WebLogic Domain to Introspect\nFor the purpose of this documentation, we are going to introspect an existing Oracle SOA 11.1.1.7 environment running on two VMs, that consists of a 2 node SOA Cluster and 2 node OSB Cluster, as illustrated in the WebLogic Admin Console.\n     \n       \n     \nNote: MyST supports introspection of 11.1.1.7, 12.1.3 and 12.2.1 WebLogic, SOA, OSB and BPM environments.\nStep 2. Define WebLogic Domain to MyST\nBefore we can introspect an existing domain we need to provide details of the physical or virtual servers that the WebLogic domain is to be provisioned to, plus SSH connection details.\nTo do this in MyST, we need to add each WebLogic host to the Pre-Existing Infrastructure Providers. From the side menu navigate toInfrastructure > Infrastructure Providers, this will display a list of existing Infrastructure Providers. From here, open the required Infrastructure Provider (or simply add a new one).\nThis will open the Infrastructure Providers screen. From here we need to define a host for each of our existing WebLogic hosts. To do this, click Add Host.\n     \n       \n     \nFor each host we need to specify the following details:\n\nName - Name within MyST used to refer to the host.\nHost Name - Network address of the host, can also be the IP Address.\nCompute Definition - Used to specify the Operating System of the target host.\nSSH Port - The SSH Port of the target host, defaults to 22.\nEnvironment(s) - Hosts must be tagged to one or more Environments. This integrates with the Role Based Access Control to define who has access to the host.\nOS agent credentials - The OS agent credentials is the set of credentials that MyST uses to connect to the host over SSH and run the MyST introspection agent on the host. These credentials consist of the SSH user name and either a password or a key pair (these are also defined within the Infrastructure Provide.\n\nConfigure OS Agent Credential - For introspection purposes, we can leave this set to No.\n\n\nStep 3. Introspect SOA / BPM Domain\nFrom the side menu navigate toModeling > Platform Blueprint, this will display a list of existing Platform Blueprints. Click on Create New in the top right-hand corner of the screen. This will launch the New Platform Blueprint wizard.\n     \n       \n     \nIn the initial dialog we need to specify the following details about our Platform Blueprint:\n\nName - Shorthand name for the Platform Blueprint.\nDescription - A longer description of the Platform Blueprint.\nWorkspaces - This defines the Workspaces to which the Platform Blueprint belongs. See Role-Based Access Control for further details.\nInitial Version - Specifies the initial version of the Platform Blueprint, we will stick with the default.\n\nFinally, we need to specify that we want to use introspection to create the Platform Blueprint. Select Introspect and click Next.\nSpecify WebLogic Domain to Introspect\nNext, we need to specify the host for the WebLogic Admin Server. First select the infrastructure provider where we defined our WebLogic hosts (in step 1), then from the drop down select the host for the WebLogic Admin Server.\n     \n       \n     \nNext specify the absolute location of the WebLogic Domain home directory, which is something like:\n/u01/app/oracle/admin//aserver/\nAt this point we are not going to create a Platform Model, so leave the default option of No for this drop down.\nFinally, click introspect. MyST will introspect the target Platform Instance. Click Next to view the summary.\nReview the Summary\nMyST will display a Summary screen showing details of the introspected Platform.\n     \n       \n     \nOnce done, click Finish.\nView/Edit Platform Blueprint\nMyST will create the corresponding Platform Blueprint and take you to the Platform Blueprint Editor where you can make additional configuration changes if required.\n     \n       \n     \nWe can now use this Platform Blueprint to provision an equivalent WebLogic Domain either on-premise or in the cloud.\nAlternatively, we can upgrade the Platform Blueprint to a newer version and use it provision an equivalent upgraded environment - see Upgrading an Existing Platform for further details.\n"},"platform/upgrade/":{"url":"platform/upgrade/","title":"Upgrading Platform Instances","keywords":"","body":"Upgrading Platform Instances\nIn order to get the latest bug fixes and feature enhancements from your Oracle product investments, regular updates need to be applied. Fundamentally, there are two types of updates:\n\nOne-off patches: These are provided by Oracle and available for download from My Oracle Support to fix a specific defect or add a minor enhancement. One-off patches can be applied directly through MyST by first defining them within a Platform Blueprint then applying them to a Platform Instance.\n\n\nUpgrades: An upgrade will introduce a significant number of bug fixes and major enhancements in one hit. Without MyST, an upgrade is usually resource intensive and risky. With MyST, an upgrade can be automated which significantly de-risks the upgrade process. This section primarily focuses on this type of upgrade. Upgrades can be either:\n\nSide-by-Side: also known as Out-of-place or Blue/Green\nor Direct: also known as In-place\n\n\n\nSide-By-Side Upgrades\nMost organizations, when migrating to Oracle SOA 12c or Oracle BPM 12c, choose to perform a side-by-side upgrade as it:\n\nrequires zero downtime\nsupports all SOA and BPM components\nallows for a phased migration\ninvolves significantly less risk\n\nThis involves provisioning a new instance of SOA/BPM 12c, replicating the configurations from your 11g platform and migrating and deploying your code. Once ready, you then switch over from 11g to 12c.\nMost organizations fail to maintain accurate documentation of their current 11g configurations, so have to manually reverse-engineer their existing 11g production configurations so they can be re-applied to their new 12c environments. This is both time consuming and error prone approach.\nMyST provides a simple and automated process for side-by-side upgrades. It allows administrators to introspect an existing 11g environment, extract the key configuration information and then use this to automatically provision an equivalent 12c environment in minutes.\nSide-By-Side Upgrades made Simple\nWhen performing a side-by-side upgrade, MyST will introspect the existing environment and create a corresponding 11g Platform Blueprint.\nNext, specify the Oracle Middleware version required. MyST will automatically convert the Platform Blueprint to one that is compliant with the Oracle Enterprise Deployment Guide, whilst preserving any custom configuration.\nFinally, specify the target environment(s) for the new upgraded domain. Then at the click of a button, MyST will automatically provision an equivalent upgraded Oracle Middleware platform.\nThe end-to-end process consists of three simple steps and can be performed in minutes as shown below.\nAlthough this example is for an 11g to 12c upgrade, the approach would be consistent for alternative version upgrades such as an upgrade from 12.1.3.0.0 to 12.2.1.2.0 or from 12.2.1.0.0 to 12.2.1.3.0.\n\nStep 1 - Introspect SOA / BPM 11gR1 Domain\nFor the purpose of this guide, we are going to introspect an existing Oracle SOA 11.1.1.7 environment running on two VMs, that consists of a 2 node SOA Cluster and 2 node OSB Cluster.\nThe steps for introspecting an existing Oracle SOA or BPM environment are documented in the chapter - Creating a Platform Blueprint from an Existing WebLogic Domain.\nIntrospection is only required if the environment to be upgraded was provisioned outside of MyST (e.g. by manual installation or another alternative method). If environment was built with MyST, the existing Platform Blueprint can be upgraded(as shown in the next step) rather than introspecting the environment first and creating one.\n\nStep 2 - Upgrade 11g Platform Blueprint to 12c\nThe next step is to upgrade the 11g SOA Platform Blueprint to create a new SOA 12c Platform Blueprint. From the side menu navigate to Modeling > Platform Blueprints, this will display a list of existing Platform Blueprints. Click on Create New in the top right-hand corner of the screen. This will launch the New Platform Blueprint wizard.\n     \n       \n     \nIn the initial dialog, we need to specify the following details about the Platform Blueprint:\n\nName - Shorthand name for the Platform Blueprint.\nDescription - A longer description of the Platform Blueprint.\nWorkspaces - This defines the Workspaces to which the Platform Blueprint belongs (Role Based Access Control allows administrators to manage which workspaces a user has access to.)\nInitial Version - Specifies the initial version of the Platform Blueprint, we will stick with the default.\n\nFinally, we need to specify how we want to create the Platform Blueprint, select the option to Upgrade from an existing blueprint and click Next.\nSpecify Oracle Middleware Upgrade Version\nNext, we need to specify the Platform Blueprint that we want to upgrade, so from the drop down select the introspected Platform Blueprint; Oracle SOA 11.1.1.7 in our example.\n     \n       \n     \nNext, we need to select the version of Oracle SOA 12c we want to upgrade to, in our example we will upgrade to 12.2.1.0.0. Once done, click Next.\nReview the Summary\nMyST will display a screen showing the summary of the old Platform Blueprint that will be upgraded and the new Platform Blueprint that it will create in the process.\n     \n       \n     \nWe can review these details. Once done, click Finish.\nView/Edit Platform Blueprint\nMyST will automatically convert our 11gR1 SOA Platform blueprint to an equivalent SOA 12c Platform Blueprint, whilst preserving the custom configurations that were previously applied to the 11g environment. This includes configurations such as JDBC Data Sources, File Stores, JMS Servers, JMS Modules, JCA Adapters and SAF Agents.\nOnce created, MyST will open the Platform Blueprint Editor where additional configuration changes can be made; for example, we may want to add in the Enterprise Scheduler Service that wasn't included in 11gR1.\n     \n       \n     \n     \n       \n     \nThe first image above is that of the 11g Platform Blueprint while the second one below is that of the 12c one we created just now.\nIf we look closely at the 12c Platform Blueprint, we can see that the number of Data Sources is different. In the 11g Platform Blueprint, there were 10 JDBC Data Sources but in the 12c Platform Blueprint, there are 15 JDBC Data Sources (see box 1 outlined in red above). This is because in SOA 12c, changes were made to database schemas and corresponding JDBC Data Sources required by the Oracle SOA Platform.\nWhen upgrading to 12c, MyST has the knowledge to remove the 11g data sources that are no longer needed and create the additional ones required for 12c. MyST has preserved the one custom data source, StockDS which is colored white (as opposed to product data sources in light green) in the screenshot above.\nIn addition, when the SOA 11gR1 domain was originally created, the middleware version number was specified as part of the Domain Name, for example acme11g_domain. The corresponding directory locations Domain Home, Domain Aserver Home, etc, also have this in their file path (see box 2 outlined in red above).\n     \n       \n     \nTo change this, place the Platform Blueprint into Edit mode and update the WebLogic Domain name to acme12c_domain. Click on Calculate resolved values now.\nWe can see that MyST automatically shows the resolved values based on the new name.\n     \n       \n     \nWith this minor edit, we are now ready to provision the new 12c environment. Typically when migrating to 12c, we will want to create multiple non-production environments, such as DEV, SIT, UAT and PRE-PROD to test and validate that the migrated code is performing as expected before promoting into Production.\nWith MyST, we can use the same Platform Blueprint to provision all these environments, ensuring each environment is consistent with Production. For each environment we want to provision, we need to create a Platform Model. This essentially maps the Platform Blueprint to the target infrastructure and captures environment specific configuration details, such as credentials.\nStep 3 - Create Platform Model and Provision\nOnce we have finalized the migrated Platform Blueprint, the next step is to create a Platform Model and then use that to provision a Platform Instance. For more details on how to do this see Chapter 3.2 - Creating a Platform Model.\nDirect Upgrades\nA Direct Upgrade involves taking an existing platform including all of its configuration and migrating it directly. It does not have the many benefits of a Side-by-Side Upgrade and it will require a a longer outage.\nWhen to do a Direct Upgrade\nAs a general rule, Side-by-Side Upgrades are the safest and simplest type of upgrade to execute. However, there are some circumstances where a Direct Upgrade may be the only option.\n\nUnavailablity of hardware resources to maintain parallel environments.\nWhen we have a lot of model-specific settings in MyST Studio and want to avoid re-creating the Platform Models\nWhen our application is architected in a way that we are unable to do a side-by-side upgrade.\n\nWhen not to do a Direct Upgrade\nWe should avoid doing a Direct Upgrade\n\nWhen we want to be able to rollback immediately in the event of a failure.\nWhen we want to minimise downtime or avoid downtime altogether.\n\nTypes of Direct Upgrades\nThere are two types of Direct Upgrades:\n\nFresh: This involves terminating the current instance and then re-provisioning it on the new version. It is the safest type of Direct Upgrade as it relies on a standard Oracle installation rather than the in-place upgrade tools from Oracle which are less reliable and do not work in all cases.\nState-preserving: This is the riskiest type of upgrade but it has the benefit of preserving the long running state of existing deployed applications. If you want to perform a State-preserving upgrade with MyST we would recommend raising a support ticket.\n\nDirect Upgrades made Simple\nBefore performing a fresh direct upgrade, MyST will need to have existing Platform Blueprint and one or more Platform Models based off that.\nIf a Platform Blueprint and Models for your existing environments does not exist, we can introspect them using MyST.\nWhen performing a fresh direct upgrade for a platform instance, terminate the instance, update the version number within the Platform Blueprint then re-provision the instance.\nThe end-to-end process consists of two simple steps and can be performed in minutes.\nFor the purpose of this guide, we are going to upgrade an existing Oracle Service Bus 12.1.3 environment to 12.2.1 using a fresh direct upgrade approach.\nAlthough this example is for a 12.1.3 to 12.2.1 upgrade, the approach would be consistent for alternative version upgrades such as an upgrade of 11.1.1.7.0 to 12.1.3.0.0 or from 12.2.1.0.0 to 12.2.1.1.0.\n\nStep 1 - Upgrade 12.1.3.0.0 Platform Blueprint to 12.2.1.0.0\nSpecify Oracle Middleware Upgrade Version\nFrom the Blueprint Editor click Edit Configuration. Then, navigate to the Middleware Settings in the tree.\nChoose the version, 12.2.1.0.0 from the drop-down, the click Save to save the Blueprint.\n     \n       \n     \nView/Edit Platform Blueprint\nMyST will automatically convert the 12.1.3 Platform Blueprint to an equivalent 12.2.1 Platform Blueprint, whilst preserving the custom configuration that were previously applied to that environment. This includes configurations such as JDBC Data Sources, File Stores, JMS Servers, JMS Modules, JCA Adapters and SAF Agents.\nIf we look closely at our Platform Blueprint, we can see that there are some subtle differences. For example, if we are using the default Fusion Middleware Home Directory of /u01/app/oracle/product/fmw1213 we will see that it has changed to /u01/app/oracle/product/fmw1221.\nIf a custom Home Directory under Middleware Settings is being used, this must be changed so that it is unique before performing an upgrade. For example, if it is set to /opt/my-company/12.1.3.0.0/soa, it should be changed to /opt/my-company/12.2.1.0.0/soa.\nRemember, a reference to the version ${[rxr.wls.Fmw-1].version} may be used e.g. /opt/my-company/${[rxr.wls.Fmw-1].version}/soa. If this property reference is already being used, then it would have changed the path automatically. Once the property reference is set within the Home Directory, it will update automatically for future upgrades.\nMake sure that any other property references to the version in the configuration which are hardcoded are using a reference, whilst it may not cause the upgrade to fail it will be a source of confusion for the upgraded platform.\n\nOnce the upgraded Platform Blueprint has been reviewed, click on Save & Commit. When prompted, enter a description for the change.\n     \n       \n     \nWith these minor edits, we are now ready to upgrade our environments. Typically when upgrading, we will want to create multiple non-production environments, such as DEV, SIT, UAT and PRE-PROD to test and validate that the migrated code is performing as expected before promoting into Production. With MyST, we can use the same Platform Blueprint to upgrade all these environments, ensuring each environment is consistent with Production.\nStep 2 - Terminate and Re-provision the existing environment\nFrom the Actions menu for any Platform Instance, there is the option to Terminate. This will destroy the WebLogic Domain on the file system to allow for it to be upgraded. This approach is described in more detail in the section on Managing Platform Instances.\nPlease be aware when this is performed, existing application state will be lost. Do not use this approach for an application architecture with long running processes. In this case, it is advisable to perform a State-preserving Upgrade which can be facilitated by raising a request to MyST Support.\n\nWhen ready to do a fresh direct upgrade to an instance associated with the upgraded Platform Blueprint, simply trigger the Terminate then perform a Reprovision.\n"},"platform/resources/weblogic/":{"url":"platform/resources/weblogic/","title":"Platform Configuration","keywords":"","body":"Platform Configuration\nMyST's approach of using Platform Blueprints / Models to define the target state of our Oracle Middleware infrastructure allows us to automate not just the initial provisioning of the Oracle Middleware platform instance, but also its configuration.\nThis configuration can be applied, either as part of the initial provisioning of the platform instance or later by modifying Platform Blueprints / Model and performing an update action against the Platform Instances.\nThis section details how to define some of the more common Oracle Middleware configurations, such as:\n\nWebLogic Servers - For example, JTA Timeout, Server Startup Arguments and Classes.\nOracle Patches - To guarantee correct patch-levels\nJDBC Data Sources - With examples for Oracle RAC, Microsoft SQL Server and IBM DB2\nJava Messaging Service (JMS):\nPersistent Store Configuration\nJMS Modules, Queues and Topics\nStore and Forward (SAF) Services.\n\n\nJCA Adapters - Such as DB, JMS and File Adapters\nWork Managers - Such as constraint and request classes\nLoad Balancer Frontends - To ensure correct rewriting of server URLs\nWebtier Routing Rules - To define Oracle HTTP Server routings\nUsers, Groups, Roles and Policies - For advanced setting such as Role Conditions and Credential Maps\nKeystore Certificates - For apply certificates to keystores\nStartup and Shutdown Classes - To trigger custom startup or shutdown operations\nWebLogic Deployment Targeting - For targeting of default resources\n\n\nThis section only covers a subset of the configurations that can be performed by MyST. If the configuration you need to apply is not documented here, please raise a ticket at support.rubiconred.com to ask for assistance.\n"},"platform/resources/weblogic/servers/":{"url":"platform/resources/weblogic/servers/","title":"WebLogic Servers","keywords":"","body":"WebLogic Servers\nThis chapter details how to define core WebLogic Server configurations, this includes:\n\nServer Start-Up Arguments\nServer Start-Up Classes\nJTA Timeout\n\nServer Startup Arguments\nServer Startup Arguments are used for providing arguments to the Java Virtual Machine for specific WebLogic Server instances. These are most commonly used for configuring memory settings. \nMyST makes it simple to configure the server startup arguments on a per-product basis. For Server Startup Arguments, MyST automatically generates a property under Global Variables for each product, with the naming convention .args. \nWhen we create our Platform Model, the WebLogic server instances are generated by MyST, which automatically reference the appropriate property. \n\nThis makes is easy to define a common property once to be used across a number of WebLogic Server instances in a cluster rather than managing each Server's properties separately like you would have to do when using the WebLogic Administration Console to do manual configuration.\n\nSo for example, if we have a SOA domain, containing both SOA and OSB, then MyST would generate the Global Variables osb.args and soa.argsas illustrated below.\n     \n       \n     \nServer Startup Arguments defined with the convention .args are applied during start up by the WebLogic Node Manager. This is different to those defined with the convention .userMemArgs which are instead applied by manipulating the start-up scripts directly. \nDue to a WebLogic product constraint, the Admin Server arguments cannot be managed by the Node Manager. Thus Admin Server start-up arguments should be defined using the property admin.server.userMemArgs. MyST automatically does this for you by default (as illustrated above).\n\nIn 11g, Coherence cluster arguments were required to be defined under the server start arguments. As this is a complex and error-prone process, MyST Studio will automatically generate this for you when you have products in your Blueprint that use Coherence out of the box, such as SOA Suite. You don't have to worry about missing this step or making a mistake.\n\nConfigure Environment Specific Startup Arguments in the Platform Model\nIt's quite common to provide fewer resources to a Development or Testing environment compared to Production. As a result, these environments often require different memory settings.\nMyST makes it simple to override the startup arguments defined in the Platform Blueprint by configuring environment specific Startup arguments in our Platform Model\n. \nTo do this, navigate to the Global Variables within the Platform Model. By default, MyST will show the start-up arguments inherited from the Platform Blueprint. To override these simply edit the values as required within the Platform Model.\n\nWe also have the option of overriding the startup arguments when we first create the Platform Model by specifying these on the Advanced tab of the Platform Model Configuration override stage of the Platform Model wizard.\n\nStartup and Shutdown Classes\nWebLogic allows us to configure startup and shutdown classes in order to perform tasks when we start up or gracefully shut down the server. \nTo add start-up and shutdown classes to the Platform Blueprint, open the Platform Blueprint Editor and type startup in the search bar and locate Startup & Shutdown Classes.\n     \n       \n     \nTo add a Startup or Shutdown Class, click on the corresponding + symbol. This will show a dialog prompting you to enter a name for the class.\n     \n       \n     \nEnter a name and press OK. The startup class should now be selected and available for configuring additional properties.\nFor each Startup/Shutdown Class we need to specify the following properties:\n\nName - An alpha-numeric value that identifies the startup class configuration. This name attribute is for your identification purposes only.\n\nTargets - The cluster to which the class is to be deployed.\n\nClass Name - Fully qualified name of the Java class.\n\nDeployment Order - Determines order in which classes are loaded and executed. Items with the lowest Deployment Order value are loaded first. Priority is relative to other deployable items of the same type.\n\nArguments - Arguments that the WebLogic server uses to initialize a class. Multiple arguments must be separated by a comma. For example attribute1=value1,attribute2=value2\n\n\nBy default WebLogic Server startup classes are run after the server initializes JMS and JDBC services, and after applications and stand-alone modules have been deployed and activated. We can modify this behavior by configuring the following properties:\n\nLoad Before App Deployments - Causes the targeted servers to load and run a startup class before it activates JMS and JDBC services and before it starts deployment for applications and EJBs.\n\nLoad Before App Activation - Causes the targeted servers to load and run a startup class before it activates applications and EJBs.\n\n\n\nNote: The startup or shutdown class must be on the classpath of each server to which it is assigned. See Application Blueprints for further details.\n\nConfigure JTA Timeout\nTo set the JTA Timeout in the Platform Blueprint, open the Platform Blueprint Editor and type jta in the search bar and locate JTA Configuration.\n     \n       \n     \nClick the Generate button (outlined above).\nSet the Timeout Seconds attribute to the required value. Once done your settings for the component should look something like:\n     \n       \n     \n"},"platform/resources/weblogic/patches/":{"url":"platform/resources/weblogic/patches/","title":"Oracle Patches","keywords":"","body":"Oracle Patches\nOracle often provides patches for their products. These patches can be applied through a utility provided by Oracle known as OPatch. MyST Studio has full support for applying these Oracle patches. This can be done by defining patches directly in the Platform Blueprint.\n\nNote: Prior to 12c, WebLogic patches were not applied by OPatch and were instead done through a tool called BSU. MyST Studio has support for both OPatch and BSU allowing patching for any of the products in the 11g and 12c product families.\n\nBefore MyST Studio can apply patches, they need to be first downloaded from My Oracle Support. Once downloaded, patches should be made available for consumption by MyST Studio. One common approach for doing this is to place the patches on a software share that is made available to all target hosts. This is the approach that we will take.\nAdd Patch to Platform Blueprint\nHow you apply a patch depends on whether you are patching an Oracle Middleware 11g or 12c instance:\n\nOracle Middleware 11g - Oracle patches are applied on a per-product basis. This means that in the MyST Studio blueprint editor, you would define the patches under the specific product being patched.\n\nOracle Middleware 12c - Oracle patches are applied globally for all of Oracle Middleware rather than on a per product basis. For that reason, in 12c, it is recommended to define patches under Oracle WebLogic as a convention.\n\n\nTo add a patch to the Platform Blueprint, open the Platform Blueprint in Edit mode and navigate to Blueprint > Products  > Oracle WebLogic.\nWith the Component in edit mode, locate the Patches and click on +.\n     \n       \n     \nThis will add a new Patch to the Patch List. For each Patch we need to specify the following properties:\n\nPatch Id - The patch id provided by Oracle that identifies the patch.\nEnsure - Whether or not to apply or remove a patch. If left blank, it will apply the patch.\nDescription - Free format text field that explains the purpose of the patch\nFile - The absolute path to the file that contains the Patch.\n\n     \n       \n     \nOnce done click Save.\nHandling Patch Dependencies\nFrom time to time, you may need a prerequisite patch to be installed before you can apply a patch. This can be handled by defining the prerequisite patch and referencing it's identifier in the Pre-requisite patches field. This field can contain comma-separated values in a case of multiple prerequisites.\nApplying the Patch to a Platform Instance\nIf the patch is added to the Platform Blueprint prior to provisioning the Platform Instance then the patch will be automatically applied as part of the provisioning process.\nIf the Platform Instance has already been provisioned then we will need to first run an update action on the Platform Instance and then run patch action to apply the patch. \nFor details on how to do this, see the section on Patching a Platform Instance\n in Chapter 3.6 - Managing Platform Instances for further details.\n"},"platform/resources/weblogic/jdbc/":{"url":"platform/resources/weblogic/jdbc/","title":"Data Sources (JDBC)","keywords":"","body":"Data Sources (JDBC)\nConfiguring JDBC Data Sources in MyST is a two stage process.\n\nFirst, define the Data Source in the Platform Blueprint. Here we define the common and default configuration details for the Data Source.\nSecond, define the environment specific details in each of the Platform Models, for example the database URL and connection credentials.\n\nConfiguring Data Source in Platform Blueprint\nAdd Data Source to Platform Blueprint\nTo add a new data source in the Platform Blueprint, open the Platform Blueprint Editor and navigate to Blueprint > WebLogic Domain Configuration > JDBC Data Sources. Expand this component to see a list of currently defined data sources.\nClick on the + icon next to JDBC Data Sources (outlined in red) and enter a name for the JDBC Data Source. Click OK.\n     \n       \n     \n\nNote: An alternative way of creating a new Data Source is to select an existing data source, right click on it and select Clone.\n\n     \n       \n     \n Initially, none of the JDBC properties will be set.\nEdit Data Source in Platform Blueprint\nTo edit an existing data source in the Platform Blueprint, open the Platform Blueprint Editor and navigate to Blueprint > WebLogic Domain Configuration > JDBC Data Sources. Expand this component to see a list of currently defined data sources and select the data source you wish to edit. Enter the required values as detailed in JDBC Data Source Properties\nDelete Data Source from Platform Blueprint\nTo delete an existing data source from a Platform Blueprint, open the Platform Blueprint Editor and navigate to Blueprint > WebLogic Domain Configuration > JDBC Data Sources.\nExpand this component to see a list of currently defined data sources. Select an existing data source, right click on it and select Remove.\nJDBC Data Source Properties\nThis section details all the properties that we can set for a JDBC data source in the MyST platform blueprint. To see all properties that are available, ensure Show advanced properties has been enabled as illustrated below.\n     \n       \n     \nThe majority of these properties are optional. If a property is Not Set then MyST will not set that property when configuring a data source, meaning WebLogic will use the default value. Property values of type password are automatically encrypted by MyST.\nComponent Properties\nFor each JDBC data source we need to specify the following component properties:\n\nName - Enter a name for this JDBC data source.\n\nType - The type of data source. Supported types are Generic, GridLink. This value defaults to Generic.\n\nTarget - Reference to the WebLogic Cluster or Admin Server that the JDBC Data Source is targeted to.\n\nUsername - Username used to connect to the database. This may or may not be a generic value. If it changes per environment then you do not need to set it in your Platform Blueprint.\n\n\nGeneral Parameters\nUnder General Parameters we can specify the following properties:\n\nJNDI Name - Enter the JNDI path to where this JDBC data source will be bound.\n\nTransaction - The transaction protocol for a JDBC data source determines how connections from the data source are handled during transaction processing. Transactions within a JDBC data source are either global (XA) or non-global (local).\n\nData Sources - Use this only when using Multi Data Source. Comma-separated list of data sources. If the Algorithm Type is set to Failover, the connection request is sent to the first data source in this list. In case the connection fails, the request is sent to the next data source in this list.\n\nAlgorithm Type - Use this property only when using Multi Data Source. The algorithm type defines whether you want an active-active (load balancing) or an active-passive (failover) configuration. Supported types are Load-Balancing or Failover.\n\nFailover Request If Busy - Use this property only when using Multi Data Source and if the Algorithm Type is set to Failover. Set this property to Yes if you want to failover the connection request to the next data source if all the connections in the active data source are in busy.\n\n\nDriver Parameters\nUnder Driver Parameters we need to specify the following properties:\n\nURL - The JDBC connection URL.\n\nDriver Class Name - The fully qualified class name of the JDBC driver class used to create the physical database connections. Ensure that this driver class supports the transaction behavior you have configured in Global Transactions Protocol.\n\nProperties - Optional list of properties passed to the JDBC driver. For each property we need to define the following attributes:\n\nKey - The property id\nValue - The property value\n\n\n\nConnection Pool\nUnder Connection Pool we can specify the following properties (if not specified WebLogic will use default values):\n\nInitial Capacity - The minimum number of physical connections to create when creating the connection pool.\n\nCapacity Increment - The number of additional connections created when new connections are added to the connection pool.\n\nMaximum Capacity - The maximum number of physical connections that this connection pool can contain.\n\nMinimum Capacity - The minimum number of physical connections that this connection pool maintains.\n\nStatement Cache Size - The number of prepared and callable statements stored in the cache. (This may increase server performance.)\n\nTest Connections On Reserve - Enables WebLogic Server to test a connection before giving it to a client. Requires that you specify a Test Table Name.\n\nTest Frequency - The number of seconds between when WebLogic Server tests unused connections. Requires that you specify a Test Table Name. Connections that fail the test are closed and reopened to re-establish a valid physical connection. If the test fails again, the connection is closed. When set to 0, periodic testing is disabled.\n\nTest Table Name - The name of the database table to use when testing physical database connections. This name is required when you specify a Test Frequency and enable Test Reserved Connections.\n\nSeconds To Trust An Idle Pool Connection - The number of seconds within a connection use that WebLogic server trusts that the connection is still viable and will skip the connection test, either before delivering it to an application or during the periodic connection testing process.\n\nConnection Creation Retry Frequency Seconds - The number of seconds between attempts to establish connections to the database.\n\nRemove Infected Connections - When set to Yes (which is the default value), the physical connection is not returned to the connection pool after the application closes the logical connection. Instead, the physical connection is closed and recreated. When set to No, when the application closes the logical connection, the physical connection is returned to the connection pool and can be reused by the application or by another application.\n\n\nONS\nUnder ONS we can specify the following properties:\n\nFan Enabled - Applicable only to RAC configurations.\n\nONS Nodes - JDBC Oracle parameters for ONS client configuration.\n\n\nConfigure environment specific properties in Platform Model\nFor each Platform Model we need to define the environment specific values for each Data Source, this typically comprises the following properties:\n\nURL - This is the URL for the database that we want our Data Source to connect to.\n\nUser Name - The user name used to connect to the database.\n\nPassword - The password used to connect to the database.\n\n\nWhen it comes to defining the URL and User Name, one option is to use MyST properties to minimize the number of specific property values we need to define within the Platform Model.\nFor example, we could define username as\nUsername = ${[rxr.def.Product-rcu].param[db-user-prefix]}_STOCK\nThe RCU prefix defined in the Platform Model will then be prepended to _STOCK to create the Username. So for example if the RCU prefix was DEV we would get the username DEV_STOCK.\n     \n       \n     \nIn addition, if we are creating multiple data sources against the same database, another option is to define a global variable in the Platform Blueprint, for example stockDb.Url which we can then reference in each Data Source that connects to that database as follows:\nURL = ${var.stockDb.Url}\nWe will, of course, need to set the value of stockDb.Url in the Platform Model, but would only need to set this once, irrespective of how many data sources referenced this.\nIn addition, we may want to override other settings in the Platform Blueprint as they may differ between environments. For example, we may have smaller connection pools or only be using Oracle RAC in Pre-Prod and Prod.\nTo edit a data source in the Platform Model, open the Platform Model Editor and navigate to Blueprint > WebLogic Domain Configuration > JDBC Data Sources. Expand this component to see a list of currently defined data sources and select the data source you wish to edit.\nAny values you enter here will override the corresponding value in the Platform Model. Once done, click Save to save these values within the Data Source and then click Save & Commit to save the Platform Model and commit our changes.\nExample JDBC Data Source Configurations\nThe following section contains example JDBC Data Source configurations for:\n\nOracle Database\nOracle RAC\nIBM DB2\nMicrosoft SQL Server\n\nCreating a JDBC Data Source for Oracle Database\nBelow is an example configuration for an Oracle DB data source.

Each JMS Server will need to be pinned to a separate managed server in the cluster.\n\nPersistent Store - We will need to define a dedicated persistence store for each JMS Server. See Configuring Persistent Stores for further details.\n\nJMS Module - We will typically define a JMS Module targeted at a specific cluster. This acts as a configuration container for JMS Resources, such as:\n\nSub Deployment - We will typically define one sub deployment per JMS Module and target it to the set of JMS servers running on the WebLogic Server cluster targeted by the JMS Module\nConnection Factories - Used to create a connection with a JMS provider (i.e. queue or topic).\nUniform Distributed Queue - A JMS Queue for a JMS server.\nUniform Distributed Topic - A JMS Topic for a JMS server\n\n\n\nThe following screenshot illustrates a typical JMS configuration within a Platform Blueprint, for a two node cluster, we would define two JMS Servers as illustrated below.

Add this configuration if you want to include a load balancer in your configuration.\nMyST supports the definition of a load balancer to ensure that server URLs are correctly re-written to route through the load balancer. If you have blocked direct access (i.e. not via a load balancer) from the corporate network to your server instances (which is a generally a recommended good practice) then the setting of the load balancer will be mandatory otherwise you will find that URLs you expect to be able to access will get blocked.\nA load balancer definition in MyST can have many frontend definitions. A frontend represents a host and port combination. If you are providing access from the load balancer front-end over HTTP or HTTPS you should set its port (typically this is 80 for HTTP and HTTPS 443). If you are not providing access to a given port from the load balancer frontend you should set the port to 0 to prevent the server URLs being re-written to route to this protocol erroneously.\nSome of the parameters for the frontend, such as the host, are environment-specific and need not be specified in a blueprint. In this case, you can enter the value \"?\" for these parameters, and define them in your platform model. MyST will validate that you have defined this value in your platform model at the time of a platform update or provision. When you define the same parameters in your platform model, the values provided in the platform model will take precedence over the values provided in the platform blueprint.\nCreating a frontend entry\nSetting up a load balancer frontend requires settings across the Platform Blueprint and Model as shown below.\n\n\n\nProperty\nDescription\nScope\n\n\n\n\nIdentifier\nThe load-balancer ID used to reference the frontend when defining clusters and managed servers.\nBlueprint\n\n\nHost\nThe frontend host's address.\nModel\n\n\nHttp Port\nThe frontend host's HTTP address.\nBlueprint\n\n\nHttps Port\nThe frontend host's HTTPS address.\nBlueprint\n\n\n\nFrom the Edit mode in a Platform Blueprint navigate to the Frontend List within Load Balancer Configuration and click Add Item.\nEnter an identifier for the Frontend. This is an important part of the definition as the identifier will be used to reference our frontend from given clusters or servers.

This is a special identifier. When we set it to this, MyST will automatically set the frontend for every cluster and the admin server to be the fmw frontend. This saves you time in manually targeting but should be avoided if you require different frontends per cluster (e.g. soa.mycompany.com for SOA Suite Cluster and osb.mycompany.com for Oracle Service Bus Cluster).\nOnce one or more Frontends are set in the Platform Blueprint, you will need to define the Host in the Platform Model as shown below.

To simplify this, there is a property that is dynamically created at runtime, which can be used to automatically retrieve this list of server addresses. This property is core.webtier.cluster\\[CLUSTER-ID\\].server-addresses. At run time, it will automatically create the server list as above without the need to explicitly define all the listen-address and listen-port elements of the servers in the cluster.\n\n> Note: When you enable root permissions through the flag core.product\\[webtier\\].param\\[root-permissions-enabled\\], it is assumed that the operating system group which owns the home defined by core.product\\[webtier\\].home is \"oracle\". If this is not the case, then this property must be overridden with the custom property webtier.oracle.group. For example:\n\n`webtier.oracle.group=dba`\n\n\n\nTODO: Determine if the below content migrated from CLI should be included or not.\n\n| Cluser List \\[ID\\] > Server Addresses | Computed from Servers in a given cluster and used within the generate moduleconf routing rules |\n\n\n> Note: The above configuration contains only the details required for the Oracle HTTP Server configuration. However, typically there are a number of additional configuration properties which are also required for WebLogic server configuration as well. By defining the Oracle HTTP Server and WLS configuration in the same definition, it is possible to perform the Oracle HTTP Server configuration at the same time as WebLogic server configuration.

It has become the default build tool for Oracle Middleware.\nMaven addresses two aspects of the build process; first, it describes how to build the software, and second, it describes any build time dependencies.\nThe Project Object Model or POM is an XML File that provides all the configuration information required by Maven for the build, such as the software project being built, its dependencies on other external modules and components, the build order, directories, and required plug-ins. \nFor each artifact that we wish to build, we need to create a corresponding POM file. Once created, we need to commit that to our Version Control System so that we can perform automated builds from our CI Server.\nPopulating Binary Repository with Maven plugin\nThe Oracle Maven Synchronization plugin supports populating local and remote repositories with artifacts from a given Oracle Middleware installation. Detailed instructions are available in the Oracle documentation on how to setup your Binary repository. \nYou must perform the one-off synchonization step in your local environment or Continuous Integration server before you can build Oracle SOA and related artifacts using Maven.\n\nSample commands are shown below. \nSeeding a local repository\nThis is useful for a basic local build setup.\nUpdate the values of ORACLE_HOME to suit the target environment.\nexport ORACLE_HOME=/opt/app/oracle/product/fmw1221\n\nmvn install:install-file \\\n-Dfile=${ORACLE_HOME}/oracle_common/plugins/maven/com/oracle/maven/oracle-maven-sync/12.2.1/oracle-maven-sync-12.2.1.jar \\\n-DpomFile=${ORACLE_HOME}/oracle_common/plugins/maven/com/oracle/maven/oracle-maven-sync/12.2.1/oracle-maven-sync-12.2.1.pom\n\nmvn com.oracle.maven:oracle-maven-sync:push \\\n-DoracleHome=${ORACLE_HOME} -DtestingOnly=false\nSeeding a remote repository\nThis approach is recommended for a Continuous Integration server and/or a team of developers. When a build is run on any server with the same Maven settings.xml the required libraries will be automatically downloaded if they are missing.\nUpdate the values of ORACLE_HOME, and MAVEN_SERVER to suit the target environment. Note: This command could take up to 2 hours to complete, depending on network performance.\nexport ORACLE_HOME=/opt/app/oracle/product/fmw1221\n\nmvn deploy:deploy-file \\\n-Dfile=${ORACLE_HOME}/oracle_common/plugins/maven/com/oracle/maven/oracle-maven-sync/12.2.1/oracle-maven-sync-12.2.1.jar \\\n-DpomFile=${ORACLE_HOME}/oracle_common/plugins/maven/com/oracle/maven/oracle-maven-sync/12.2.1/oracle-maven-sync-12.2.1.pom \\\n-Durl=http://${MAVEN_SERVER}:8081/artifactory/ext-release-local/ -DrepositoryId=artifactory\n\nmvn com.oracle.maven:oracle-maven-sync:push \\\n-DoracleHome=${ORACLE_HOME} -DtestingOnly=false -DserverId=artifactory\nFor the above to work, you should define your Maven Repository connection details in the Maven settings.xml. Below is an example for Artifactory.\n\n\n      \n      \n      admin  \n      password  \n      artifactory  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n      oracle-repo              \n      \n         /opt/app/oracle/product/fmw1221\n      \n              \n        \n          artifactory\n          artifactory\n          http://localhost:8081/artifactory/ext-release-local\n          default\n          \n             false\n          \n          \n            never\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    oracle-repo\n  \n\n\nDefining our Project Object Model\nEach automated Maven build should have a Project Object Model (also knows as pom) which is defined in a pom.xml file at the project root directory.\nAt a minimum a pom.xml must contain a groupId, artifactId and version (also known as a GAV classifier) and a modelVersion to indicate the version of the Maven Project Object Model itself. At the time of writing, 4.0.0 is the latest pom version.\nBelow is an example of the most minimal pom.xml to create a single jar file\n\n 4.0.0\n com.acme\n my-jar-achive\n 1.0-SNAPSHOT\n\nGiven this pom.xml and a source code structure as follows...\nhello-world\n├── pom.xml\n└── src\n    └── main\n        └── java\n            └── com\n                └── acme\n                    └── hello_world\n                        └── Main.java\n\n6 directories, 2 files\n...when I navigate to the hello-world project directory from a Terminal and execute mvn package then a Java Archive will be compiled and packaged to target/hello-world-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\nMaven Parents\nMaven supports the concept of project inheritance. This can be useful when you want to have a common set of properties and plugins that are reused by multiple projects. This is also the mechanism that Oracle use to enable a given pom.xml to build a certain project type. \nProject inheritance is achieved through the concept of a Parent POM which is in-turn referenced by the Project POM. Below is an example pom.xml for building an Oracle Service Bus (OSB) archive for the 12.2.1.0.0 version of Oracle SOA Suite.\n\n\n  4.0.0\n  \n    com.oracle.servicebus\n    sbar-project-common\n    12.1.3-0-0\n  \n  com.acme\n  stock-services\n  1.0-SNAPSHOT\n  sbar\n\nIn addition to the automated build, the MyST build plugin will use the parent for Oracle-specific artifacts to determine the deploy-time Artifact Type. This is important as MyST uses different deploy-time strategies depending on the Artifact Type.\nThe below table contains the details of common Parent POMs provided by Oracle and their corresponding MyST Artifact Type.\n\n\n\nMyST Artifact Type\nGroup ID\nArtifact ID\nSupport Versions\n\n\n\n\nADF\ncom.oracle.adf\nadf-parent\n12.1.3-0-0, 12.2.1-0-0\n\n\nSOA/BPM Composites\ncom.oracle.soa\nsar-common\n12.1.3-0-0, 12.2.1-0-0\n\n\nOSB Configuration\ncom.oracle.servicebus\nsbar-project-common\n12.1.3-0-0, 12.2.1-0-0\n\n\n\nJDeveloper Examples\nOracle JDeveloper 12c has native support for Apache Maven.\nBuilding Oracle Service Bus Projects in JDeveloper with Maven\nIn this section, we provide a detailed walkthrough on how to create a POM file in JDeveloper. In this example, we will show how to create a POM file for an OSB project. A similar approach would also be used for other artifact types.\nWithin JDeveloper, locate the OSB project that we wish to build with Maven. Right click on the project and click New and then select From Gallery.\n     \n       \n     \nType pom into the Search Bar and then select Empty POM (Maven).\n     \n       \n     \nClick OK. JDeveloper will open the Create a Maven POM dialog. Leave the defaults when prompted to enter the location and click Ok.\n     \n       \n     \nIf prompted to overwrite an existing file, select Yes.\n     \n       \n     \nJDeveloper will then prompt us to enter the following values:\n\nGroup Id: The groupId for your new project. This usually starts with your organization's domain name in reverse format. For example com.acme.\nArtifact Id: The artifactId for your OSB project. This is usually an identifier for this project.\nVersion: The version for our OSB project.

Metadata files created during design time in JDeveloper are referenced from MDS at run time by these applications.\nWhere MDS artifacts containing environment specific values are being manually deployed, these values must be modified at source before each deployment. This approach is not practical for continuous integration.\nA common solution is to create sets of Ant/Maven scripts, and search and replace values of these files before deployment by looking up environment specific values defined in property files. This approach provides an improvement over the manual approach, but a number of issues remain, namely:\n\nThere is a risk that non-centralized property files and values will be copied and pasted around, increasing the risk of configuration drift over time.\nThis type of bespoke build and deploy scripting tends to grow more complex and less maintainable over time.\nThere is a significant ongoing effort involved in bringing custom scripting to a robust level of usability.\n\nThe ideal MDS deployment solution should overcome all of the above issues, and MyST Late Binding from MyST Studio does exactly that.\nApplying MyST Late Binding \nMyST Late Binding involves tokenizing files with MyST data model property references which will be de-referenced and expanded to their corresponding data values during  deployment (ie after build and initial packaging).\nDuring deployment, MyST Late Binding expands the MDS jar/zip file, and performs a MyST property search and replace on *.ep.wsdl, *.wsdl and *.xml files with environment specific values obtained from the MyST engine; it re-packages the files back into the MDS archive file, and performs deployment to import metadata to MDS runtime server.\nSteps \nThe following steps are required to achieve MDS customization using MyST Late Binding found in MyST Studio:\n\nUpdate all Platform Models with the latest environment specific values in MyST Studio.\nUpdate MDS metadata source files with MyST property references. Only *.ep.wsdl, *.wsdl and *.xml file types will be searched and replaced.\n\nCreate an MDS build job in a CI server that integrates with MyST Studio via MyST Reverse Register Plugin.\n\nNote: The plugin will automatically register Artifacts in Myst Studio for your successful MDS builds - you don't need to create them manually. \n\n\nCreate further configurations for MDS deployment in MyST Studio, such as creating a Release Pipeline or a Release Definition.\n\nRun MDS deployment via MyST Studio and the customization will be applied correctly.\n\n\nApplying MyST Generic Configuration Plans \nIf you find that late binding is not sufficient for your particular use case, you can use a MyST Generic Configuration Plan. This solution can update any file in the MDS project. Fortunately, a generic configuration plan only requires minimal configuration effort.\nSteps \nThis section summarizes the steps to apply a MyST Generic Configuration Plan to an MDS deployment in MyST Studio.\n\nUpdate all Platform Models with the latest environment specific values in MyST Studio. \nIn your file system, create a generic configuration plan file called myst-config-plan.xml. An example is given below. For detail see MyST Generic Configuration Plans\n\nPut this file under the META-INF folder in the MDS project's root directory.\n\nCreate an MDS build job in a CI server that integrates with MyST Studio via MyST Reverse Register Plugin.\n\nNote: The plugin will automatically register Artifacts in Myst Studio for your successful MDS builds - you don't need to create them manually.\n\n\nCreate configurations for deployment in MyST Studio , such as creating a Release Pipeline or a Release Definition.\n\nRun MDS Deployment via MyST Studio and the customization will be applied correctly.\n\n\nSOA Customization \nThis section provides details on customizing SOA projects with MyST Studio.\nThere are two customizations that can be applied for customizing SOA projects against the target environment, these are:\n\nApplying MyST Late Binding on SOA Configuration Plan\nApplying MyST Generic Configuration Plan\n\nIn SOA applications, Oracle provides a customization solution known as a Configuration Plan. A Configuration Plan is an xml document generated from a SOA composite.xml using JDeveloper or the WLST scripting tool.\nA configuration plan, when applied during deployment via JDeveloper or Oracle supplied Ant script, can modify the content of files within a SOA application, hence the SOA application is tailored for the target environment, such as Production.\nSOA configuration plans support customization of the composite file (composite.xml), any wsdl imported from composite.xml (.wsdl), any xml schema file (.xsd) and JCA adapter files (.jca).\nHowever, there are limitations to what can be changed by configuration plan, only certain properties and attributes can be modified. For detail please see: Deploying SOA Composite Applications - 11g Release 1 (11.1.1.6.3). For any environment value tokenization that cannot be achieved via SOA configuration plan, you can always apply MyST Generic Configuration Plan. This will be discussed shortly.\nIn a SOA project, typically developers generate one configuration plan from the composite.xml, then tailor the configuration plan for the target environment, or make various copies of the plan file. The maintenance of multiple configuration plans can be a nightmare. Firstly, the endpoint values are hard coded into the configuration plans. When an endpoint changes, developers must refactor that endpoint in all configuration plans across all affected SOA projects.\nA better solution common in continuous integration is to write custom Ant/Maven scripts to automatically search and replace a single configuration plan per SOA project. This approach provides an improvement over the first approach, but a number of issues similar to those discussed for custom MDS deployment scripts remain.\nThe ideal SOA deployment solution:\n\nshould maintain only a single configuration plan.\ndoes not require manual maintenance of property values across potentially numerous SCAs.\nshould be a common and standardized solution across application tiers. \n\nMyST Late Binding from MyST Studio fulfills the above requirements.\nApplying MyST Late Binding on SOA Configuration Plan File \nWith MyST Studio, only a single configuration plan is required per SOA project regardless of the number of environments, and this is achieved by MyST property late binding. During deployment, MyST will expand the SOA jar/zip file, and perform a MyST property search and replace on *.ep.wsdl, *.wsdl and *.xml files with environment specific values obtained from the MyST engine; it then packages the files back into the SOA archive file and performs deployment.\nSteps \nThis section summarizes the steps to apply an SOA configuration plan with MyST Studio.\n\nUpdate all Platform Models with the latest environment specific values in MyST Studio. \nIn each SOA project, generate a configuration plan from the SOA composite.xml file and named it \"cfgplan.xml\".\n\nModify the configuration plan to replace any environment specific detail with MyST property references.\n\nAdd any missing configuration in the configuration plan.\n\nCreate an SOA build job in a CI server that integrates with MyST Studio via MyST Reverse Register Plugin.\n\nNote: The plugin will automatically register Artifacts in Myst Studio for your successful SOA builds - you don't need to create them manually.\n\n\nCreate configurations for deployment in MyST Studio, such as creating a Release Pipeline or a Release Definition.\n\nRun SOA Deployment via MyST Studio and the customization will be applied correctly.\n\n\nApplying MyST Generic Configuration Plan \nIf the standard SOA configuration plan is not sufficient for your particular use case, you can apply a MyST Generic Configuration Plan. This solution can update any file in the SOA project. Fortunately, generic configuration plan only requires minimal configuration effort.\nSteps \nThis section summarizes the steps to apply a MyST Generic Configuration Plan to an SOA deployment in MyST Studio.\n\nUpdate all Platform Models with the latest environment specific values in MyST Studio. \nIn your file system, create a generic configuration plan file called myst-config-plan.xml. An example is given below. For detail see MyST Generic Configuration Plans\n\nPut this file under the META-INF folder in the SOA project's root directory.\n\nCreate an SOA build job in a CI server that integrates with MyST Studio via MyST Reverse Register Plugin.\n\nNote: The plugin will automatically register Artifacts in Myst Studio for your successful SOA builds - you don't need to create them manually.\n\n\nCreate configurations for deployment in MyST Studio, such as creating a Release Pipeline or a Release Definition.\n\nRun SOA Deployment via MyST Studio and the customization will be applied correctly.\n\n\nOSB Customization \nThis section provides details on customizing OSB projects with MyST Studio.\nThere are two customizations that can be applied for customizing OSB projects against the target environment, these are:\n\nApplying MyST Late Binding on OSB Customization File\nApplying MyST Generic Configuration Plan\n\nApplying MyST Late Binding on OSB Customization File \nCustomization of common OSB values, including environment values, operational settings, and reference mappings, can be achieved by using an OSB customization file. In 11g this customization file is called ALSBCustomizationFile.xml; in 12c it is called OSBCustomizationFile.xml. For details please see the Oracle documentation: Customizing Oracle Service Bus Environments.\nIn many Oracle middleware projects, developers generate an OSB customization file from the OSB console on a given environment, eg TEST. They will then make a copy of the generated (TEST) configuration file for the other target environments and customize those copies accordingly (eg for UAT, PREPROD, PROD). In other words, there is a customization file to be maintained per environment/project combination.\nThis approach generally works fine, but it requires maintenance for each environment. For example, if there are five environments and 20 OSB projects, 100 customization files must be maintained in a project.\nThe solution to this problem is to maintain only 1 customization file per OSB project regardless of the number of environments .\nInstead of keeping environment specific values in the environment specific customization files, MyST Studio maintains these values in the Platform Models. In the OSB customization file, the environment specific values must be replaced with MyST property references. The benefit of this tokenization is that only a single OSB customization file needs to be maintained.\nDuring deployment, MyST Late Binding will expand the OSB jar file and perform a MyST property search and replace on OSB customization files with environment specific values obtained from the MyST engine; it packages the files back into the OSB archive file, and finally import OSB projects to OSB server.\nThe major advantage of this approach is that all team members only need to maintain environment specific values in a single location, ie in the Platform Model.\nSteps \nThis section summarizes the steps to apply an OSB customization file with MyST Studio.\n\nUpdate all Platform Models with the latest environment specific values in MyST Studio. \nIn each OSB project, export the OSB customization file as OSBCustomizationFile.xml (for both 11g and 12c OSB projects) and put it under the root directory of the OSB project. The below diagram shows a 12c example. \n\n     \n       \n     \n\nModify the customization file to replace values with MyST property references. \n\n     \n       \n     \n\nAdd any missing customization where required.\n\nCreate an OSB build job in a CI server that integrates with MyST Studio via MyST Reverse Register Plugin.\n\nNote: The plugin will automatically register Artifacts in Myst Studio for your successful OSB builds - you don't need to create them manually.\n\n\nCreate configurations for deployment in MyST Studio, such as creating a Release Pipeline or a Release Definition.\n\nRun OSB Deployment via MyST Studio and the customization is applied correctly.\n\n\nApplying MyST Generic Configuration Plan \nIf the standard OSB customization file is not sufficient for your specific use case, then you can apply a MyST Generic Configuration Plan. This solution can update any file in the OSB project. Fortunately, generic configuration plan only requires minimal configuration effort.\nIn some cases, an OSB customization file alone isn't enough to customize OSB projects to the target environment. For example, a proxy service may be configured with the File JCA transport, which contains environment specific JCA properties such as \"PhysicalArchiveDirectory\". These properties must also be replaced before OSB deployment.\nIn this case, MyST can use its own Generic Configuration Plan framework to capture environment properties and apply them to an artifact during deployment.\nDuring OSB deployment in MyST Studio, MyST reads the generic configuration plan and compiles it down to a list of actions to replace any environment specific values before importing the OSB jar file into the target environment via the OSB import function provided by MyST Studio.\nSteps \nThis section summarizes the steps to apply a MyST Generic Configuration Plan to an OSB deployment in MyST Studio.\n\nUpdate all Platform Models with the latest environment specific values in MyST Studio. \nIn your file system, create a generic configuration plan file called myst-config-plan.xml. An example is given below. For detail see MyST Generic Configuration Plans\n\n     \n       \n     \n\nPut this file under the META-INF folder in the OSB project's root directory.\n\nCreate an OSB build job in a CI server that integrates with MyST Studio via MyST Reverse Register Plugin.\n\nNote: The plugin will automatically register Artifacts in Myst Studio for your successful OSB builds - you don't need to create them manually.\n\n\nCreate configurations for deployment in MyST Studio, such as creating a Release Pipeline or a Release Definition.\n\nRun OSB Deployment via MyST Studio and the customization will be applied correctly.\n\n\nBAM Customization \nThis section provides details on customizing BAM projects with MyST Studio.\nThere is one customization that can be applied for customizing BAM projects against the target environment, this is:\n\nApplying MyST Generic Configuration Plan\n\nOracle BAM allows users to create dashboards and monitor business services and processes. Typically, deploying BAM is a simple process of running the command line tool\nto export artifacts from a source environment into a zip file format, and then import that zip file into a target environment.\nThe command line tools are different for 11g and 12c as follow:\n\n11g: icommand (Location: /Oracle_SOA1/bam/bin)\n12c: bamcommand (Location: /soa/bam/bin)\n\nThere is no out-of-the-box customization solution for BAM provided by Oracle.\nIn 12c, typically developers manually modify the bam zip file, or use bespoke scripting, to amend any files with environment specific values before running the bamcommand utility. However, this approach presents a challenge to automated continuous integration.\nFortunately, MyST Studio's Generic Configuration Plans provide a simple yet powerful solution to overcome this issue. With generic configuration plans, only a single copy of the bam zip file needs to be maintained and no manual modification is required.\nApplying MyST Generic Configuration Plan \nMyST uses the generic configuration plan framework that can capture environment properties and apply them to an artifact during deployment.\nIn BAM deployment, a generic configuration plan replaces values in files within bam zip file with environment specific values before importing the bam zip file into the target environment via the bamcommand utility by MyST Studio.\n \nSteps \nThis section summarizes the steps to apply MyST Generic Configuration Plans on BAM deployment in MyST Studio.\n\nUpdate all Platform Models with the latest environment specific values in MyST Studio. \nPerform the below prerequisite steps, then export a bam zip file from the bam console. \n  Setting up 12c bamcommand\n  Update the /soa/bam/BAMCommandConfig.xml file to point to the correct BAM server host and port.

Over its lifecycle, an application will typically have multiple releases made into production, consisting of major and minor functional releases, as well as maintenance releases. \nDuring the lifetime of each release, code that makes up an Application Release will be built and promoted many times to various environments such as Development, System Integration Test (SIT), User Acceptance Test (UAT) and Pre-Prod as it makes its journey to Production.\nOver this journey, Application Blueprints are used to define the artifacts that constitute a version of an Application Release. The Application Blueprint is version controlled, allowing full control of the configuration of an Application release over time, and provides the flexibility to roll forward/backward to a different version of the release at any point in time.\nThis part contains the following chapters:\n\nConfiguring Application Blueprints   \n\n\n"},"deploy/application/blueprints/":{"url":"deploy/application/blueprints/","title":"Configuring Application Blueprints","keywords":"","body":"Configuring Application Blueprints\nList Application Blueprints\nFrom the side menu navigate toRelease Management > Application Blueprints, this will display a list of existing Application Blueprints, similar to the one below.\n     \n       \n     \nBy default, MyST will display the list of Application Blueprints using the Card view. To switch to the list view, click on the List View icon (outlined above in red). MyST will display the Applications Blueprints in a list, as illustrated below.\n     \n       \n     \nIn the list view, we are able to filter the list by typing part of the Application Blueprint name in the Name filter (outlined above in red).\nCreate Application Blueprint\nClick + Create New, this will open the Application Blueprint dialog. Here we need to specify the following values:\n     \n       \n     \n\nName - Shorthand name for the Application Blueprint\nDescription - A longer description of the Application Blueprint\nVersion - Specifies the initial version of the Application Blueprint. See Application Blueprint versioning for further details.\n\n     \n       \n     \nNext, we need to add the required artifacts to our application blueprint. Click on the + icon next to Artifacts, this will open the Add Artifacts window, which by default will list all artifacts available.\n     \n       \n     \nFor each artifact, MyST displays the following information:\n\nName - The artifact name\nGroup Id - The maven group id of the artifact.\nArtifact Id - The maven artifact id of the artifact.\nComponent Type - This is the type of artifact, for example, OSB, SCA, MDS, JAR and so on.\n\nWe can filter this list by one or more of these values by entering the filter criteria in the corresponding filter fields (outlined in red).\nTo add an artifact, simply select its checkbox; to remove an artifact from an Application Blueprint, deselect it.\nOnce happy with the selection click Add.

Typically we would have a maximum of two versions under development at any point in time: one for main development (like a trunk in version control) and another one optionally for patches (like a production fix for an earlier version of the Application Blueprint deployed into Production).\nEach time we edit the artifacts within an Application Blueprint Version, or a new build of an artifact contained within an Application Blueprint is published, MyST automatically creates a new revision. These revisions are tracked through the Release Pipeline so we can determine exactly what is deployed into each environment at any point in time.\nTo edit an Application Blueprint, go to the list view, click on the Actions drop-down for the corresponding Application Blueprint, and select Open. This will open the Application Blueprint editor.\n     \n       \n     \nWhen we open an Application Blueprint, the editor defaults to the latest version of the Application Blueprint. We can select View next to a different version to change to an earlier version.\nWithin the editor we can update the Application Blueprint Name and Description; it should be noted that these are held at the Application Blueprint level, not at the version level, meaning any changes to these values will be reflected across all versions of the Application Blueprint.\nWe can also add, delete or edit the list of artifacts contained within an Application Blueprint. These changes are version specific and will result in a new revision of the Application Blueprint.\nCreate New Application Blueprint Version from Existing\nTo create a new version of an Application Blueprint, we need to open an existing version of the Application Blueprint.\nNext we need to click on a previous version that we wish to base our new version from and select Clone from the available Actions. MyST will prompt us to provide the new version number for the Application Blueprint. Once entered, click Create.\n     \n       \n     \nDelete Application Blueprint Version\nWe can delete unpublished Application Blueprint versions which are not included within a Release Pipeline.\nTo delete a specific version of an Application Blueprint, open it in the Application Blueprint editor, and select Delete from the available Actions next to the version you wish to delete.\n     \n       \n     \nMyST will prompt us with the message, You are about to delete this version permanently.

These stages will typically be aligned with each of the staging environments in our Software Delivery Lifecycle, for example, CI, SIT, UAT, and PROD.\nEach stage has a promotion scheme, which can be automatic or manual. Automatic is useful for Continuous Integration, whereas manual is useful when you want to control when the deployment is triggered. \nFor manual deployments, we also have the option of specifying whether it requires approval prior to deployment.\nRelease Streams\nA Release Pipeline can consist of one or more Release Streams. A Release Stream is targeted to an Oracle Middleware platform as defined by its Platform Blueprint and can contain zero or more Application Blueprints. \nA common use case for multiple Release Streams would be if you wanted to perform a release across multiple WebLogic domains, such as a release to an ADF and SOA WebLogic Domain.\nFor each stream, we would specify zero, one or more Application Blueprints that we want to deploy.\nDeployment Platforms\nFor each Stage / Release Stream combination, we need to specify the Platform Instances that we want to target the deployment of the corresponding Platform Blueprint and Application Blueprints to.\nFor example, if we have the stages CI, SIT, UAT and PROD in our Release Pipeline and a single stream SOA to manage the deployment of Oracle SOA artifacts, then we would need to specify the following four deployment targets:\n\nCI SOA Platform\nSIT SOA Platform\nUAT SOA Platform\nPROD SOA Platform \n\nAnd for every additional stream, we would need to specify an additional four Platform Instances.\nPipeline Groups and Stream Types\nPipeline Groups and Stream Types are user defined. These allow us to categorize each Release Pipeline and Stream and are used for reporting purposes. \nRole of Pipeline Templates\nMost organizations will have a \"standard\" software delivery lifecycle (SDLC) that they follow for the implementation of Oracle Middleware projects. These may vary slightly based on the type of release. For example, we may follow one SDLC for \"project releases\", but have a shorter SDLC for \"patch\" releases.\nPipeline Templates allow us to pre-define a set of ordered stages with promotion schemes defined for each stage. The value of Pipeline Templates is that they allow us to define a standard approach for each type of release.\nFor example, in the above scenario, we could define two templates: one for project releases and a second for patch releases.\nThis part contains the following chapters:\n\nPipeline Organization   \nPipeline Groups   \nStream Types\n\n\nPipeline Templates\nConfiguring Release Pipelines\nRelease Pipeline Dashboards\n\n"},"release/pipeline/organization/":{"url":"release/pipeline/organization/","title":"Pipeline Organization","keywords":"","body":"Pipeline Organization\nPipeline Groups and Stream Types are user defined.

Templates","keywords":"","body":"Pipeline Templates\nIt is common practice for organizations to have a \"standard\" software delivery lifecycle (SDLC) that they follow for the implementation of Oracle Middleware projects. \nThese may vary slightly based on the type of release. For example, we may follow one SDLC for \"project releases\", but have a shorter SDLC for \"patch\" releases.\nPipeline Templates allow us to pre-define a set of ordered stages with promotion schemes defined for each stage. The value of Pipeline Templates is that they allow us to define a standard approach for each type of release.\nSo in the above example, we could define two templates: one for project releases and a second for patch releases.\nList Release Pipeline Templates\nFrom the side menu, navigate toRelease Management > Pipeline Template. This will display a list of existing Release Pipeline Templates, similar to the one below.\n     \n       \n     \nCreating a New Release Pipeline Template\nClick + Create New. This will open the Release Pipeline Template dialog. Specify the following values:\n\nName - Shorthand name for the Pipeline Template.\nDescription - A longer description of the Pipeline Template.\n\n     \n       \n     \nNext, we need to define the stages in our Release Pipeline Template.\nAdd Stage\nTo add a stage, click Add Stage. This will open the Stage dialog. \n     \n       \n     \nFor each stage, we need to specify the following values:\n\nName - Shorthand name for the stage.\nDescription - A longer description of the stage.\n\nEnvironment - The Environment Type to be used for this stage. Only Platform Models with the same environment type will be available for use in this stage.\n\nPromotion Rules - Defines how Application Blueprints and Platform Blueprints are promoted into this stage. This can be either:\n\nAutomatic - Instructs MyST to automatically promote changes to this stage. \nManual - Indicates that promotion has to be manually triggered.\n\n\n\nOnce we have defined our stage, click Save to add the stage to our Release Pipeline Template.\n\nNote: We will need to repeat these steps for each stage we wish to add to our Pipeline Template. For example, if our software delivery lifecycle consists of four stages, CI, SIT, PRE and PROD, then we would add a corresponding stage for each of these to our Release Pipeline template.\n\nSequence Stages\nBy default, the stages in our Release Pipeline will be sequenced in the order that we created them.\n     \n       \n     \nIf we wish to change the stage sequence, simply click on the up or down arrow next to the stage (outlined in red in the above screenshot) to move it to an earlier or later stage in the pipeline template.\nOnce we are happy with our Release Pipeline Template, click Save to Save the new Release Pipeline Template.\nDelete Stage\nTo remove a stage from the Release Pipeline Template, click on the corresponding  trash can icon in the Actions column for the stage to be deleted.\nEdit Release Pipeline Template.\nTo edit the Pipeline Template, from the side menu navigate toRelease Management > Pipeline Template.

We can edit these if required.\n\nAdd Stage - To add a stage, click Add Stage. This will open the Stage dialog. Here we need to specify the Stage Name, Description, Stage Environment Type and Promotion Rules.\n\nEdit Stage - To edit a stage, click on the pencil icon for the corresponding stage.

If we want to change the stage sequence, simply click on the left or right arrow next to the stage (outlined in red in the above screenshot) to move it to an earlier or later stage in the pipeline.\n\n\nConfiguring Release Streams\nWithin a Release Pipeline, a Stream is used to define the Platform Blueprint and Application Blueprint(s) to be promoted through each stage.\nA Release Pipeline can consist of one or more Release Streams. A Release Stream is targeted to an Oracle Middleware platform as defined by its Platform Blueprint and can contain zero or more Application Blueprints. \nA common use case for multiple Release Streams would be if you wanted to perform a release across multiple WebLogic domains such as a release to an ADF and SOA WebLogic Domain.\nFor each stream, we would specify zero or more Application Blueprints that we want to deploy.\nAdd Streams\nTo add a stream to our Release Pipeline, click Add Stream. This will open the  Stream Editor. Here we need to specify the following values:\n\nName - Shorthand name for the Release Stream.\n\nDescription - A longer description of the Release Stream.\n\nStream Type - Select the Stream Type to which the stream belongs.\n\nPlatform Blueprint and Version - See Configuring a Streams Platform Blueprint Version.\n\nApplication Blueprint(s) - Select the Application Blueprints to be promoted through the stream\n\n\nConfiguring a Stream's Platform Blueprint Version\nFor each stream, we need to define its target Platform Blueprint and Version. Once defined MyST will only make available for deployment Platform Models / Instances that are based on the stream's Platform Blueprint and Version.\n     \n       \n     \nThis is to ensure the Platform Instance deployed to at each stage of the Release Pipeline has the same configuration.\nAs it is possible to have multiple revisions of the same Platform Blueprint version, MyST also allows us to specify how we want MyST to handle a scenario where a Platform Instance is not on the latest committed revision of the Platform Blueprint version. \nThis is controlled with the Behavior option, which can be one of:\n\nUpdate - MyST will update the Platform Instance to the latest committed revision of the specified version of the Platform Blueprint and Model. The update action will be performed prior to deploying any Application Blueprints to the Platform Instance.\n\nNone - MyST will not perform any platform specific actions against the Platform Instance.\n\n\nConfiguring a Stream's Application Blueprints\nFor each stream, we need to define the set of Application Blueprints whose deployment and promotion we want to manage as part of the release pipeline.\nWithin the Application Blueprint(s) section of the Stream editor, select the required Application Blueprints from the list of Application Blueprints. \n     \n       \n     \nFor each Application Blueprint we need to specify:\n\nVersion - Specifies the version of an Application Blueprint to be deployed.\n\nRevision - Each time there is a new revision of an artifact contained within an Application Blueprint, MyST will create a new revision of the Application Blueprint. Within a Release Stream, we can configure MyST to always use the latest revision of an Application Blueprint or pin a specific revision of an Application Blueprint to the stream.\n\nSequence - This defines the sequence in which Application Blueprints are deployed. To change the order, simply click on the up or down arrow next to the Application Blueprint (outlined in red above) to move it to an earlier or later stage in the deployment.\n\n\nConfiguring Platform Deployment Targets\nFor each stream, we need to specify the target platform for each stage in the Release Pipeline. The target platform is the Platform Instance to which MyST will apply the Platform Configuration changes as defined by the Platform Blueprint as well as deploy and configure the artifacts defined by the Application Blueprints.\nFor each Stream / Stage combination, we will see a drop down in the Release Pipeline (as outlined in red below). \n     \n       \n     \nFrom this, we can select the Platform Model of the Platform Instance that we wish to target for deployment. The Platform Models available in the drop down will be automatically filtered:\n\nPlatform Blueprint and Version - The drop down list will be automatically filtered to only show Platform Models based on the Platform Blueprint and Version as specified in the stream configuration.\nEnvironment Type - The drop down list will be automatically filtered to only show Platform Models for the stage environment type as specified in the stage configuration.\n\nWhen we select the Platform Model, MyST will update the Release Pipeline to show the Platform Blueprint and Platform Model revision for the corresponding Platform Instance (as outlined in red above). If the Platform Instance has not yet been provisioned, then this will be indicated.\n\nActivate Release Pipeline\nOnce we have configured our Release Pipeline, we need to activate it before it can be used to promote a release into any environment.\nOnce activated, the pipeline will execute periodically to automatically promote changes through the pipeline (where configured to do so) as well as allow the manual promotion of releases.\nAs soon as we do this, MyST is going to start deploying our application into our CI environment because we set the CI stage to automatic.\nUpon activation, MyST will take us to the Release Pipeline Dashboard. Click on Refresh. We should now see that the deployment is pending.\n\nWhilst activated, the release pipeline configuration cannot be edited. The only change that can be made is to the Application Model Properties. If we need to edit the Release Pipeline, we first need to deactivate it. We can then make the required changes before re-activating the pipeline.\n\nTo activate a Release Pipeline Template, from the side menu navigate toRelease Management > Pipelines. This will display a list of existing Release Pipelines.\n     \n       \n     \nClick on the Actions drop-down in the top right-hand corner of the pipeline you wish to activate and select Activate. MyST will prompt for confirmation of the activation, click Yes to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, from within the Release Pipeline editor, we choose the option of Save + Activate. MyST will save any changes made to the Release Pipeline and then activate the Pipeline. Once active, MyST will open the Release Pipeline Dashboard.\n\nDeactivate Release Pipeline\nThere are a number of occasions, where we may want to deactivate (or pause the execution of) a release pipeline, this includes when:\n\nWe want to make configuration changes to our Release Pipeline. For example, we may want to add additional Application Blueprints to an existing stream. \nWe have successfully delivered a release into Production, so may want to permanently deactivate the corresponding Release Pipeline.\nWe may want to delete a Release Pipeline, for example, we may be merging multiple releases into a single Pipeline.\n\nTo deactivate a Release Pipeline, from the side menu navigate toRelease Management > Pipelines. This will display a list of existing Release Pipelines. \nClick on the Actions drop-down in the top right-hand corner of the pipeline you wish to deactivate and select Deactivate. MyST will prompt for confirmation of the Deactivate action, click Yes to proceed.\nOnce deactivated, MyST will stop the execution of the Release Pipeline until re-activated.\nDelete Release Pipeline\nMyST only allows the deletion of inactive pipelines. If we wish to delete a pipeline that is currently active, we first need to deactivate it.\nTo delete an inactive Release Pipeline, from the side menu navigate toRelease Management > Pipelines. This will display a list of existing Release Pipelines. \nClick on the Actions drop-down in the top right-hand corner of the pipeline you wish to remove and select Delete. MyST will prompt for confirmation of the Delete action, click Yes to proceed with the deletion of the Release Pipeline.\n"},"release/pipeline/dashboard/":{"url":"release/pipeline/dashboard/","title":"Release Pipeline Dashboards","keywords":"","body":"Release Pipeline Dashboards\nThe Release Pipeline Dashboard provides a ‘single pane of glass’ to monitor and manage the promotion of applications and platform configuration changes through each staging environment and into Production.\nTo view the dashboard of an active Release Pipeline; from the side menu navigate toRelease Management > Pipelines, this will display a list of existing Release Pipelines. \nClick on the Actions drop-down in the top right-hand corner of the pipeline whose dashboard we wish to view and select Dashboard.\n     \n       \n     \nThe remainder of this section takes us on a tour of the Release Pipeline Dashboard, covering the following topics:\n\nPlatform Blueprint and Application Blueprint Revision Tracking\nPlatform Model and Application Model Revision Tracking\nBuild Stage\nDeployment to the First Staging Environment\nUnderstanding the Deployment Status\nPromoting a Release into a Staging Environment\nTroubleshooting a Failed Deployment\nUpdating the Application Model and Re-Deploying\nForcing a Redeploy\n\nPlatform Blueprint and Application Blueprint Revision Tracking\nEach stream in a Release Pipeline is used to manage the promotion and deployment of a set of related components, consisting of a Platform Blueprint and zero, one or more Application Blueprints. \nAny change to any of these components results in a new revision of that component. MyST keeps track of all revisions and which revision of each of these components has been promoted to each stage.\nWhen promoting a release from one stage to the next, the components are not promoted individually, but as the collection of components defined in the release stream. Each time a deployment is made into the first stage environment (for example CI), MyST creates a new Stream Revision which is a logical snapshot of the Platform Blueprint revision and Application Blueprint revision deployed into that staging environment.\nMyST keeps track of all revisions and which revision of each of these components has been promoted to each stage. The following notation is used to indicate the revision of each component:\n\nPlatform Blueprint Revisions - The revision of a platform Blueprint is indicated by the notation prn. Where pr is the standard prefix for a platform blueprint revision and n is the revision number. For example pr4 would indicate revision 4 for the specified Platform Blueprint Version.\nApplication Blueprint Revision - The revision of an Application Blueprint is indicated by the notation arn. Where ar is the standard prefix for an Application Blueprint revision and n is the revision number. For example ar3 would indicate revision 3 for the specified Application Blueprint Version.\nStream Revision - The revision of a Stream release is indicated by the notation srn. Where sr is the standard prefix for a Stream revision and n is the revision number. For example sr5 would indicate stream revision 5.\n\nIn addition to each stage, the dashboard also illustrates the Build stage, which shows the latest revision of each component available for promotion through the release pipeline. \nPlatform Model and Application Model Revision Tracking\nIn addition to tracking revisions to Platform Blueprints and Application Blueprints, MyST also tracks any revisions to either Platform Models or Application Models in each staging environment.\nFor example, a user may modify the set of properties defined in an Application Model, whilst this has no impact on the corresponding Application Blueprint. It does impact the configuration of the artifacts contained within the Application Blueprint for the stage that the Application Model applies. Thus it is important to track these changes, so MyST knows that the Application Blueprint needs to be redeployed, and allows us to cross-reference test results to particular configurations.\nIn addition, in a similar way that MyST creates a Stream Revision to track related components together, MyST creates a Stream Model Revision for each stage to track any model changes that impact that staging environment.\n\nNote: The Stream Model Revision is tracked separately for each stage.\n\nMyST keeps track of all model revisions and which revision has been applied to each component promoted into a stage. The following notation is used to indicate the model revision applied to each component:\n\nPlatform Model Revisions - The revision of a Platform Model is indicated by the notation pmn. Where pm is the standard prefix for a platform model revision and n is the revision number. For example pm2 would indicate revision 2 for the specified Platform Model.\nApplication Model Revision - The revision of an Application Model is indicated by the notation amn. Where am is the standard prefix for an Application Model revision and n is the revision number. For example am2 would indicate revision 2 for the specified Application Model.\nStream Model Revision - The revision of a Stream Model is indicated by the notation smn. Where sm is the standard prefix for a Stream Model revision and n is the revision number. For example sm5 would indicate stream model revision 5.\n\nBuild Stage\nIn addition to each stage, the dashboard also illustrates the Build stage, which shows the latest revision of each component available for promotion through the release pipeline. \n     \n       \n     \nFor example, in the above screenshot, we can see that the following components (outlined in red) are available for deployment into the CI stage:\n\npr1 of SOA Platform Blueprint v1.0.0\nar2 of Utility Service v1.0\nar1 of OrderToCash\n\nThe stream revision in the build stage is used to indicate the next stream revision available for release into the first staging environment. The content of this release is not finalized until the deployment of this release is triggered. In other words, additional changes, prior to triggering of this release, which result in a new revision to either the Platform Blueprints or any of the Application Blueprints will be included in this stream revision.\nDeployment to the First Staging Environment\nWhen the promotion rule for the first staging environment is defined as automatic, MyST will periodically check to see if there are any new revisions in the build stage ready for deployment, and if so queue a deployment job against the platform instance, as indicated by the Pending status for Next Deployment in CI Stage in the screenshot below.\n\nNote: The Next execution at indicates when MyST will next check for new revisions to be promoted. This can be overridden by clicking Run Now.\n\nIf the promotion rule for the first staging environment is defined as Manual, MyST will indicate that a release is Ready for Release, which can then be triggered manually (see below for further details).\n     \n       \n     \nThe deployment job will be placed in the job queue for the Platform Instance. This is to prevent multiple jobs for the same platform instance running in parallel. Once all preceding jobs (if any) in the queue have been completed then the deployment job will be initiated. The status of the deployment will change from Pending to In Progress as shown below.\n     \n       \n     \nUnderstanding the Deployment Status\nOnce the deployment job has executed, the dashboard will be updated to show the status of the last deployment.\nThe Last Deployment section will highlight the Stream Revision and the Stream Model Revision of the last deployment, in the format srn - smn. This will be color coded:\n\nGreen - to indicate a successful deployment.\n\nRed - to indicate a failed deployment.\n\n\nIn addition, the dashboard will display the Status, Start Time and Duration of the deployment job.\n     \n       \n     \nFor each Platform Blueprint and Application Blueprint, MyST will show the corresponding Blueprint Revision and Model Revision. These are color coded as follows:\n\nGreen - Indicates a successful deployment.\n\nLight Green - Indicates that no deployment was necessary, as there had been no change that impacted the deployed component since the last successful deployment.\n\nRed - to indicate a failed deployment.\n\n\nViewing the Deployment Log\nTo view the stage deployment log of a component, click on the Cog icon next to the corresponding blueprint - model revision for the component, and select View Log as illustrated below.\n     \n       \n     \nViewing the List of Deployed Artifacts\nTo view the list of artifacts deployed to a stage, click on the Cog icon next to the corresponding platform instance and select Deployed Artifacts.\n     \n       \n     \nMyST will display the list of artifacts currently deployed to that Platform Instance. For each artifact it displays:\n\nArtifact Group Id - The maven group id of the artifact.\n\nArtifact Id - The maven artifact id of the artifact.\n\nArtifact Version - This is the artifact binary version. \n\nBuild No - The build number of the artifact\n\nArtifact Name - The artifact name\n\n\nThis list can be sorted by clicking on the appropriate column heading.\n     \n       \n     \nViewing Pending Action(s)\nTo view the Pending Action(s) for a Platform Instance in the Release Pipeline, click on the Cog icon next to the corresponding platform instance and select Pending Action(s).\nThis will display a list of all scheduled actions against the Platform Instance, enabling us to determine if there are any actions queued ahead of our deployment actions.\nViewing the Action History\nTo view the Action History for a Platform Instance in the Release Pipeline, click on the Cog icon next to the corresponding platform instance and select Action history.\nThis will open up the action history for the Platform Instance, which will show the history of all actions performed against the Platform Instance, not just those performed by the Release Pipeline.\nPromoting a Release into a Staging Environment\nOnce a release has been successfully deployed into a staging environment and has successfully executed any Post Deployment jobs, including the execution of automated tests, MyST will mark the corresponding Stream Revision as Ready for Release in the next staging environment.\nIf the promotion rule for the staging environment is defined as Manual, MyST will set the status of the Next Deployment as Ready for Release as well as indicate the stream revision plus corresponding stream model that is ready for revision.\nTo trigger the release, click on the Cog icon next to the corresponding Ready for Release status, and select Deploy Release as illustrated below.\n     \n       \n     \nMyST will open the Revision Selection dialog, where we can select which stream revision we wish to deploy and the corresponding stream model revision.\n     \n       \n     \n\nIt is quite common, especially in the case of manual releases, for several stream revisions to be available for release at the same point in time. For example, we may make several releases a day into the CI environment, but choose to release daily into the test environment. In these scenarios MyST defaults to the latest successful stream revision, but allows us to select an earlier stream revision if required.\n\nFor the selected Stream Revision, MyST will show the corresponding platform blueprint and application blueprint revisions that make up this release. Once we are happy with the selected revision, click OK\nMyST will queue a deployment job against the corresponding platform instance. And set the status of the next deployment to Pending. As soon as the job starts executing, its status will be updated to In progress.\n     \n       \n     \nTroubleshooting a Failed Deployment\nThere will, of course, be times when a deployment fails for a variety of reasons. In such cases, it is important to be able to quickly identify where the failure occurred, so we are able to identify the root cause.\nWhen a deployment fails, the status of the last deployment is set to Failed and the stream revision and stream model revision for that deployment is highlighted in red, as illustrated below.\n     \n       \n     \nWhen MyST executes a stream deployment, it first deploys any updates to the Platform Blueprint and then sequentially deploys the Application Blueprint, skipping any components which have not changed since the last sequential deployment. If deployment of any component fails then deployment of the stream is aborted at that point.\nMyST will color code the status of each component to indicate whether it was deployed successfully or not:\n\nGreen - Indicates a successful deployment.\n\nLight Green - Indicates that no deployment was necessary, as there had been no change that impacted the component since the last successful deployment.\n\nRed - Indicate a failed deployment.\n\nGray - Indicates that MyST did not attempt to deploy that component due to an earlier failure.\n\n\nTo identify the root cause of the failed deployment, click on the Cog icon next to the failed component and select View Log. This will open the deployment Execution log file for that component.\n     \n       \n     \nLooking at the log file we can see that we have not defined the following application (app.) properties:\n\nstock.host\nstock.port\n\nUpdating the Platform Model and Re-Deploying\nThe above issue can easily be resolved by setting these properties in the Platform Model for the SIT Platform Instances. See Platform Model Editor for details on how to do this.\nOnce the Platform Model has been updated, the next execution of the Release Pipeline will detect the updated Platform Model and set the status of the release to Ready for release.\nSelect the option to Deploy Release, ensuring the latest Stream Model is selected.\n     \n       \n     \nFrom this we can see that the Stream Revision has been successfully deployed, and that the Application Model revision and the corresponding Stream Revision has been also been incremented to reflect the change at the model level.\nWe can also see that the Stream Revision is also available for deployment to the UAT Stage.\nForcing a Redeploy\nTo redeploy the last release to a stage, click on the Cog icon next to the last deployment status and select Redeploy. \n     \n       \n     \nThis will open the redeploy dialog.\n     \n       \n     \nMyST's default behavior when deploying a release is to only deploy the artifacts that have been changed since the last deployment. In the event of an Application Model change it will redeploy all the artifacts contained within that Application Model.\nHere we have the option of selecting Force deploy all artifacts. If we select this option, we can force MyST to re-deploy all artifacts contained across Application Blueprints.\nClick OK to initiate the re-deployment.\n"},"administration/":{"url":"administration/","title":"Role-Based Access Control","keywords":"","body":"Role-Based Access Control\nWithin an enterprise, there will be multiple users of MyST, performing a variety of roles in a variety of environments from Development through to Production.For example:\n\nMiddleware Administrator: Provisioning, operation and administration of Production systems\nSOA Developer: Development and testing of code on SOA projects;  responsible for deploying code into DEV and TEST environments.\nQA Tech Lead: Provisioning and configuration of QA environments, plus the deployment of code into the QA environment.\nCI Tool: Tools such as Jenkins/Hudson, for orchestrating the automated deployment and testing of code in a Continuous Integration Environment.\n\nWithin MyST, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enables us to control what resources a user has access to, and what actions they can perform across a number of dimensions, including:\n\nWhat actions a user can perform against each resource type, for example, Platform Blueprint, Platform Model, Application Blueprints, etc.\nEnvironments that a user is allowed to perform those actions in, for example, DEV, SIT, UAT, Pre-PROD, and PROD.\n\nUsers\nEach user has an individual account that at a minimum includes a unique login id, username, and password. \nWithin MyST, users are not assigned permissions directly, but only acquire them through the role(s) assigned to them within one or more workspaces. \nUsers can also be assigned System Roles, which will enable them to manage system specific configurations.\nRoles\nA role is a collection of application-related privileges that define what actions a user with that role may perform against each resource type, for example, Platform Blueprint, Platform Model, Pre-Existing Infrastructure and so on.\nA role can also be environment specific, in that it only grants application-related privileges in specific environments.

If you are not using the MyST Build Server and Artifact Repository and instead integrating with a different Build (CI) Server or Maven-based Artifact Repository, similar firewalling rules should be in place although the ports may be different.\nInstallation using the Wizard\nThe installation wizard can be kicked off by executing the jar installer using Java as follows:\njava -jar \nIf you need to run MyST Studio installer from the console (non-graphical), you can execute the following:\njava -jar  -console\nIn the first step, you will be provided with an overview of the prerequisites.\n     \n       \n     \nIn the next step, you will be asked to enter a path for the MyST Studio utilities. The standard convention is to installer under /opt/myst-studio however any path can be used.\n     \n       \n     \nIn the next step, we can choose which packs we wish to install. At a minimum MyST Studio will be selected.\n     \n       \n     \nOptionally, you can choose:\n\nMyST Build Server: Pre-configured Build Server for use with MyST for if you don't already have one.\nMyST Artifact Repository: Pre-configured Maven Artifact Repository for if you don't already have one.\nBuild Extension for Oracle Middleware: Enables automated build for applications build on SOA, BPM, OSB, ADF and other products related to Oracle Middleware. When you choose this, it will automatically select MyST Build Server if it is not already selected. The Build Extensions are currently supported for:\n12.2.1.3.0\n12.2.1.2.0\n12.2.1.1.0\n\n\n\nClick Next.\nIn the next step, you will be prompted to import the MyST license key. The file is provided when you sign up for MyST and is in a format similar to MyST-*.lic.tar.gz\n     \n       \n     \nPrior to April 2017, MyST users were provided with a separate api.key and MyST.lic file. In installers prior to 5.5.0.0, these had to be imported separately. If you do not have a tar.gz file but have api.key and MyST.lic you can compress them to a new tar.gz and use that for that installer.\n\nYou will be prompted to confirm installation. Click Next.\n     \n       \n     \nThe installation should take only a second or two.\n     \n       \n     \nAfter the installation is successful, you will be prompted with the next steps to be performed.\n     \n       \n     \nIf desired, you can generate a silent installation script which can be used to perform an installation silently.\n     \n       \n     \nSilent Installation\n\n\nTo run a silent installation you can execute the following:\njava -jar  \n\nProviding Certificates for SSL\nBy default, MyST Studio will boot up with demo SSL certificates, this may be ok for a development or sandbox environment but should  not be used for production.\nIf you do not replace the demo certificates, you will get security warnings from your browser when you access the MyST Studio console.\n\nTo update the certificates, replace the demo certificates at the following locations with your real certificates:\n\nconf/data/nginx/ssl/cert.crt\nconf/data/nginx/ssl/cert.key\n\nWarning\n\n\nIf you have already started the MyST Studio stack, you must force a rebuild of the data container when you restart the stack, this can be done with the following command.\n./bin/start.sh -u\nIf you are yet to start the stack, please continue on to the next steps. MyST will automatically build the data container on the first start.\n\nConfiguring Build Extensions\nIf you choose the Build Extensions for Oracle Middleware then you will need to download Oracle installers and a JDK. Place them in the MyST home at the following locations depending on the versions you chose:\nBuild Extensions in docker data containers are deprecated. MyST 5.8.6 uses docker volume mounts.\nDocker volume mounts allow Oracle installers to be installed on the filesystem then volume mounted to the MyST Build Server docker container.\n\n\n\n\nVersion\nFile\n\n\n\n\n12.2.1.1.0\nconf/fmw/context/jdk/jdk-8u121-linux-x64.tar.gz conf/fmw/context/12211/installers/fmw_12.2.1.1.0_infrastructure.jar conf/fmw/context/12211/installers/fmw_12.2.1.1.0_osb.jar conf/fmw/context/12211/installers/fmw_12.2.1.1.0_soa.jar\n\n\n12.2.1.2.0\nconf/fmw/context/jdk/jdk-8u121-linux-x64.tar.gz conf/fmw/context/12212/installers/fmw_12.2.1.2.0_infrastructure.jar conf/fmw/context/12212/installers/fmw_12.2.1.2.0_osb.jar conf/fmw/context/12212/installers/fmw_12.2.1.2.0_soa.jar\n\n\n12.2.1.3.0\nconf/fmw/context/jdk/jdk-8u131-linux-x64.tar.gz conf/fmw/context/12213/installers/fmw_12.2.1.3.0_infrastructure.jar conf/fmw/context/12213/installers/fmw_12.2.1.3.0_osb.jar conf/fmw/context/12213/installers/fmw_12.2.1.3.0_soa.jar\n\n\n\nOnce the Oracle installers are placed in the desired locations, you will need to install FMW by executing the following:\ncd /opt/myst-studio/fmw\n./install-fmw.sh\nFor version 12.2.1.3.0 the install-fmw.sh script will also fix Oracle Maven Plugin dependency errors.\n\nStarting the MyST Studio Stack\nAfter the successful installation navigate to the MyST Studio home (in our example, /opt/myst-studio) and execute the following:\ncd /opt/myst-studio/bin\n./start.sh\nOnce the start.sh has completed you should be able to access the MyST Studio console at https:///console.\nYou can see the details of your running instances by executing docker ps from the command line.\nConfiguring Maven for Automated Build of Oracle Middleware\nIf you choose Build Extensions for Oracle Middleware when installing MyST, Maven must be configured on the build server, before you can build applications to run on products such as SOA, BPM, OSB and ADF. This can be done by simply executing the following from the MyST Studio home where SHORT_VERSION could be 122130 if you installed OFMW 12.2.1.3.0.\ncd /opt/myst-studio/bin\n./configure-maven.sh \nIf you skipped the post-installation steps documented in the section on Configuring the Build Extensions the above command will not succeed.\n\nOffline Installation\nIt is highly recommended that proxied internet access be available for the MyST server. This allows for easy upgrade of MyST by simply specifying a version number to download (e.g. ./upgrade.sh 5.5.0.0). In an event that MyST Studio does not have internet access, you will need to download the required MyST Studio Docker Images from a host with internet access and then copy them to the MyST Server before executing the start.sh or upgrade.sh. Depending on whether you choose \"MyST Build Server\" and \"MyST Artifact Repository\", there may be multiple Docker images that need to be downloaded and copied to the server.\nMyST Studio (Offline)\nThe MyST Studio Docker Image can be downloaded from the MyST website.\n     \n       \n     \nAfter downloading the MyST Studio installer from the website, copy it to the MyST host and execute the following\ngunzip myst-studio-docker-image-5.5.0.0.tar.gz\nsudo docker load -i myst-studio-docker-image-5.5.0.0.tar\ndocker tag  docker-registry.rubiconred.aws:5000/myst-studio:5.5.0.0 myst-studio\nMake sure that you replace the above version details to correspond to that version of MyST that was downloaded.\nMyST Build Server (Offline)\nIf you are planning to use MyST Build Server on a host without internet access, from a host with internet access and Docker installed run the following:\ndocker pull jenkins\ndocker save jenkins > myst-build-base.tar\nThen copy the myst-build-base.tar to the MyST host and execute the following:\ndocker load -i myst-build-base.tar\nMyST Artifact Repository (Offline)\nIf you are planning to use MyST Artifact Repository on a host without internet access, from a host with internet access and Docker + MyST installed run the following:\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/pull.sh\ndocker save maven-repository > maven-repository.tar\nThen copy the maven-repository.tar to the MyST host and execute the following:\ndocker load -i maven-repository.tar\nBuild Extensions for Oracle Middleware (Offline)\nIf you are planning to use MyST Artifact Repository on a host without internet access, from a host with internet access and Docker + MyST installed run the following:\ndocker pull oraclelinux:7\ndocker save oraclelinux:7 > oracle-linux.tar\nThen copy the oracle-linux.tar to the MyST host and execute the following:\ndocker load -i oracle-linux.tar\n"},"installation/myst-studio/alternatives/":{"url":"installation/myst-studio/alternatives/","title":"Alternative Installations","keywords":"","body":"Alternative Installations\nGenerally, it is recommended that MyST be installed on Docker. This will enable the easiest rollout process of MyST and it's associated components as well as allowing for effortless upgrades. As new releases of MyST are shipped regularly, being able to upgrade in seconds is a desirable trait of the system. For details on installing MyST with Docker please visit this link.\n \nRecommendations aside, it is important to recognise there can be some internal constraints within an organization which prevents the use of Docker, at least in the short-term. This guide is designed for such scenarios.\nEnterprise constraints preventing use of Docker\nAn enterprise may lag behind high-performing companies for various reasons. Below are a list of common constraints in an enterprise that may prevent the use of Docker.\n\nUnable to use up-to-date kernel\nDocker requires a new-ish kernel version. Enterprises may have a Standard Operating Environment (SOE) and may not be ready to upgrade their Linux kernel to support Docker. Please refer to the Docker documentation for your specific Operating System to determine the kernel version required.\n\nRequire out-of-date Docker version\nThis is related to the previous point. If an organisation's SOE prevents the use of an up-to-date kernel then there may be a need to install an older version of Docker. Alternatively, an organisation may have an out-of-date Operating System package manager responsible for delivering out-of-date Docker versions to an operation system.\nMyST relies on the v2 compose file format meaning that it will not work with earlier versions of Docker. If you wish to use an earlier version of Docker, please raise a support ticket for assistance in configuring MyST to work with earlier versions of Docker.\n\nWaiting on a purchasing decision\nOrganisation's may choose to use RedHat or Oracle Linux. Since version 17.3+,  Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) must be licensed for  Red Hat / Oracle Linux. \nIn this case, an organisation can choose to use Docker Community Edition (CE) with non-RedHat / Oracle Linux operating systems such as the RedHat-based CentOS or other Linux derivatives such as Ubuntu. If an organisation is not willing to license EE, downgrade Docker or use a CE supporting operating system, Docker may no longer be a viable option.\n\n\nThis document exists for edge cases where an alternative means for installing MyST Studio is required. While the Docker-based installation can take minutes, the manual installation could take several hours and should be followed as a late resort only.\nInstall MyST Studio Manually (without Docker)\nMyST can be installed to run without Docker through a three step process.\n\nInstall MySQL\nInstall MyST on a Docker supporting system to extract the MyST application and configuration or download the MyST zip bundle directly.\nCopy the extracted MyST application and configuration to the non-Docker host and wire it to the MySQL database.\n\nInstall MySQL Community Edition\nMyST Studio uses MySQL Community Edition 5.7.15 to store its data. Before we install MyST Studio we must ensure that a running instance of MySQL is available and configured. General MySQL installation details can be found here\n\nDownload the yum repo file that is needed for the specific target operating system.\nThe available repo file for RedHat/Oracle Linux based systems are listed here so you download to the box with a command line this: \nwget http://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql57-community-release-el6-9.noarch.rpm\n\nInstall the repo\nsudo yum localinstall mysql57-community-release-el6-9.noarch.rpm\n\nInstall MySQL Community Edition 5.7.15\nsudo yum install mysql-community-server\n\nStart MySQL\nsudo service mysqld start\n\nVerify that it is running\nsudo service mysqld status\nmysqld (pid  1340) is running...\n\nAt the initial start-up of the server, the following happens, given that the data directory of the server is empty:\n\nThe server is initialized.\nAn SSL certificate and key files are generated in the data directory.\nThe validate_password plugin is installed and enabled.\nA superuser account 'root'@'localhost is created. A password for the superuser is set and stored in the error log file. To reveal it, use the command described in the next step.\n\n\nGet the super user password\nsudo grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log\n\nChange the root password as soon as possible by logging in with the generated, temporary password and set a custom password for the superuser account. \n\n\nMySQL's validate_password plugin is installed by default. This will require that passwords contain at least one upper case letter, one lower case letter, one digit, and one special character, and that the total password length is at least 8 characters.\n   The default MyST password is not allowed by the password validation. You may choose to remove that module and set it to the default MyST password\n (welcome1).\n   mysql -uroot -p \n   ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MyNewPass4!';\n   uninstall plugin validate_password;\n   ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'welcome1';\n\nCreate the fusioncloud schema and userCREATE USER 'fusioncloud'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'welcome1';\nCREATE DATABASE fusioncloud;\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON fusioncloud.* to 'fusioncloud'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;\n\nIncrease MySQL max allowed packet by editing /etc/my.cnf with the following under [mysqld] section[mysqld]\nmax_allowed_packet = 256M\n\n\nObtain the MyST product\nOption 1: Download the MyST Studio zip bundle\nAfter login at myst.rubiconred.com, you will be able to download the MyST Studio zip bundle from the following link https://myst.rubiconred.com/webhelp/installer/release/tomcat-myststudio-bundle-$VERSION.tar.gz. Be sure to replace $VERSION with the actual version number.\nOption 2: Obtain the MysT Studio zip bundle from the Docker image\nTo keep the MyST installation in line with what is built and delivered as part of the Docker image for MyST, we obtain a non-Docker copy of MyST product by first installing MyST on a machine which supports Docker, followed by retrieving the MyST file system and copying it to a non-Docker host. This will involve installing Docker on a supporting operating system and pulling down a specific version of a docker image for MyST, followed by creating a tar achive of the tomcat directory with the related MyST application and configuration. For information on Docker and MyST Studio installation refer to \n Docker install for your operating system version\n MyST Studio installation.\n\nOnce MyST and Docker are installed, retrieve the desired imagecd /opt/myst-studio/bin\n./pull\n\nObtain the image name for MyST. You can see a list of Docker images on the host by running docker images that will yiel an output similar to:REPOSITORY                                               TAG    IMAGE ID     CREATED     SIZE\n067343992071.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/myst-studio latest 91c4a4f58d2c 4 weeks ago 484.3 MB\n\nStart a container from the MyST Studio docker image using:\ndocker run -ti --name myststudio-tomcat : /bin/bash\nwhere : is obtained from previously running the docker images command\n\nTar the contents of the tomcat directory by first entering the container. For example:\ndocker run -ti --name myststudio-tomcat 067343992071.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/myst-studio:5.0.1.1 /bin/bash\nThen, once inside the Docker container run:\ncd /usr/local\ntar -zcvf tomcat-myststudio.tar.gz tomcat\nexit\nYour container will shutdown as soon as you exit it.\n\nCopy the tomcat-myststudio.tar.gz out of the shutdown docker container.\ndocker cp myststudio-tomcat:/usr/local/tomcat-myststudio.tar.gz .\n\n\nInstall MyST Studio\n\nVerify that the JAVA_HOME is set and the current java version is 1.7.\nWhen running java -version you should see an output similar to the following:OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 2.6.7) (7u111-2.6.7-2~deb8u1)\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.111-b01, mixed mode)\n\nCopy tomcat-myststudio.tar.gz to the MyST Studio server.\nExtract the tar to /opt/myst-studio\ncd /opt/\nmkdir myst-studio\ntar -xvf /path/to/tomcat-myststudio.tar.gz -C myst-studio\n\nAdd \"127.0.0.1   db\"  to /etc/hosts so that db resolves to 127.0.0.1. Check that a ping db sends to localhost.\nsudo vi /etc/hosts\n127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4 db\n\nInstall the MyST license by copying the MyST.lic to tomcat/conf/fusioncloud/license\nmkdir -p /opt/myst-studio/tomcat/conf/fusioncloud/license\ncp MyST.lic /opt/myst-studio/tomcat/conf/fusioncloud/license\nThe MyST.lic can be obtained from the MyST license bundle as follows:\ntar -xf /path/to/MyST-*.lic.tar.gz MyST.lic\n\nWe need to change the tomcat port to 8085.

Typically, they will not change often.\nScripts\n\n\n\nMyST Studio Script\nDescription\n\n\n\n\npull.sh\nPulls the MyST Studio container from the Public MyST Docker Registry using the customer key and tags it as myst-studio.If internet access is not available from the MyST Studio host this will need to be performed manually by downloading the Docker image from the MyST website and performing the following steps:docker load -i docker tag  myst-studio\n\n\nbackup-database.sh\nPerforms a backup of the database to MyST Studio home under the backup directory with a datetime suffix. The location is printed to the output. For example:Backed up to /opt/myst-studio/backup/myst-studio-1468979016.sqlTake note of the location as you will require this later if you intend to perform a rollback.\n\n\nupdate-database.sh\nUpdates/Restores the MyST Studio database from a previous backup as follows:./update-database.sh Before updating the database, the MyST Studio web container will be shutdown and then started up after the database update is complete.\n\n\nstop.sh\nStops the MyST Studio instances\n\n\nstart.sh\nStarts the MyST Studio instances.On boot, the MyST Studio web instance will upgrade the database if pull.sh was previously run.\n\n\noutput-logs.sh\nThis displays the MyST Studio start up logs during startup.  This can be closed by typing Ctrl+C.\n\n\nupgrade.sh\nUpgrade to a specific version of MyST Studio as follows:./upgrade.sh If the  argument is it omitted it will upgrade to the latest version. The version pulled down will be tagged as \"myst-studio\".docker tag myst-studio myst-studio:If pulling down the latest version, it is a good practise to tag a specific version number to assist with rollback.\nThe following steps will be performed as part of the upgrade script:1.

Enterprises can easily upgrade their on-premise instance of MyST Studio by pulling down the latest version directly from the web or in-directly by downloading the associated Docker images and copying them up to the MyST host.\n\nAn upgrade of the MyST container will also include the latest patches for the underlying images which it is based off such as tomcat and the operating system which it is based off.\n\nIf you are a MyST customer, who started using MyST prior to 2016, you may still be using the MyST Command-Line Interface. For details on upgrading from MyST CLI to MyST Studio see the associated section within this guide.\nUpgrade Approaches\nThere are a number of different approaches that can be taken for upgrading MyST Studio. It is advisable to choose an approach that is appropriate for your organisations availability requirements. As the downtime during an upgrade is reduced the complexity of the upgrade generally increases. For that reason, the choice of upgrade approach is generally a trade off between reducing downtime and reducing complexity. The most common upgrade approaches are:\n\nIn-Place Upgrade: This involves upgrading a single instance of MyST Studio in-place. This will require a small downtime.\nPhased Upgrade: This involves testing an upgrade on a non-production instance, before performing the upgrade on the production instance. This will still require a small downtime.\nZero Downtime Upgrade: This involves side-by-side upgrade of MyST Studio in order to reduce downtime or avoid it altogether.\n\nIn-Place Upgrade\nThe simplest upgrade approach is to have a single instance which is upgraded in-place. This upgrade approach will require an outage.\nUpgrade Steps\nStep 1: Perform the upgrade\nThis can be executed by running the following on the MyST Studio host.\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/upgrade.sh \n\nThis will require an outage of the MyST Studio instance. For a typical upgrade the outage should be no longer than 5 minutes.\n\n\n\nMyST Studio Script\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/pull.sh\nPulls the MyST Studio container from the Public MyST Docker Registry using the customer key and tags it as myst-studio. If internet access is not available from the MyST Studio host this will need to be performed manually by downloading the Docker image from the MyST website and performing the following steps. docker load -i  docker tag  myst-studio\n\n\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/backup-database.sh\nPerforms a backup of the database to MyST Studio home under the backup directory with a datetime suffix. The location is printed to the output. For example: Backed up to /opt/myst-studio/backup/myst-studio-1468979016.sql Take note of the location as you will require this later if you intend to perform a rollback.\n\n\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/stop.sh\nStops the MyST Studio instances\n\n\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/start.sh\nStarts the MyST Studio instances. On boot, the MyST Studio web instance will upgrade the database.\n\n\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/output-logs.sh\nThis displays the MyST Studio start up logs during startup.  This can be closed by typing Ctrl+C.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Verify the upgrade\nAt a minimum, the following upgrade verification steps should be performed.\n\nCheck there are no errors shown in the MyST Studio start up log\nLogin to the MyST Studio console and check that the version shown in the bottom right-hand corner is correct.\n\nRollback Steps\nIn the event of a failure during the upgrade the following steps can be performed to rollback the instance.\nStep 1: Re-tag the old image\nFind the previous version of the MyST Studio Docker Image. To see all version, you can execute the following:\ndocker images | grep myst-studio\nRe-tag the image to be called \"myst-studio\". This will ensure on the next startup that the earlier version of MyST Studio is used. Below is an example for downgrade to MyST 3.9.0.3\ndocker tag 067343992071.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/myst-studio:3.9.0.3 myst-studio\nStep 2: Restore the database\nThis can be executed by running the following on the MyST Studio host.\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/update-database.sh \nThis step will perform an outage of the MyST Studio instance. This outage should be no longer than 5 minutes.\nThe following steps are performed as part of the database update.\n\nThe MyST Studio web instance is stopped.\nThe backup SQL is executed on the database\nThe MyST Studio web instance is started.Step 3: Verify the downgrade\nAt a minimum, the following downgrade verification steps should be performed.\nCheck there are no errors shown in the MyST Studio start up log\nLogin to the MyST Studio console and check that the version shown in the bottom right-hand corner is correct.\n\n\n\nPros / Cons\nPros:\n\nSimple to setup\nNo need to manage the migration of data between instances\n\nCons:\n\nRequires an outage to perform an upgrade\nNo way to test an upgrade prior to applying it\n\nPhased Upgrade\nThis approach involves the use of separate production and non-production instances. An upgrade is first tested on non-production before applying to production.\nUpgrade Steps\nStep 1: Download the latest version of MyST Studio\nThis can be executed by running the following command.\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/pull.sh \nIf internet access is not available from the MyST Studio host this will need to be performed manually by downloading the Docker image from the MyST website and performing the following steps.\ndocker load -i \ndocker tag  myst-studio\nStep 2: Take a copy of the latest production state and import to non-production (optional)\nThis step is optional if you wish to verify with the same instance data as production.\nThe involves first taking a copy of production database of MyST Studio by executing the following\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/backup-database.sh\nThe location of the backup will be output to the terminal.\nNext, the backup will need to be copied to the non-production host and the following will need to be executed.\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/update-database.sh \nThis step will shutdown and restart the MyST Studio web instance. Because we previously downloaded the latest MyST Studio, it will be upgraded to the latest MyST Studio version on startup.\nStep 3: Upgrade MyST Studio\nIf you performed the previous step, then your instance should already be upgraded. If not you can upgrade the instance by doing a restart as follows:\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/restart.sh\nStep 4: Verify the upgrade on non-production\nAt a minimum, the following upgrade verification steps should be performed.\nCheck there are no errors shown in the MyST Studio start up log\nLogin to the MyST Studio console and check that the version shown in the bottom right-hand corner is correct.\nStep 5: If upgrade is successful, perform upgrade on production\nThis can be done from the production machine by executing the following:\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/upgrade.sh \nThis will require an outage of the MyST Studio instance. For a typical upgrade the outage should be no longer than 5 minutes.\nStep 6: Verify the upgrade on production\nAt a minimum, the following upgrade verification steps should be performed.\nCheck there are no errors shown in the MyST Studio start up log\nLogin to the MyST Studio console and check that the version shown in the bottom right-hand corner is correct.\nRollback Steps\nIn the event of a failure during the upgrade the following steps can be performed to rollback the instance.\nStep 1: Re-tag the old image\nFind the previous version of the MyST Studio Docker Image. To see all version, you can execute the following:\ndocker images | grep myst-studio\nRe-tag the image to be called \"myst-studio\". This will ensure on the next startup that the earlier version of MyST Studio is used. Below is an example for downgrade to MyST 3.9.0.3\ndocker tag 067343992071.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/myst-studio:3.9.0.3 myst-studio\nStep 2: Restore the database\nThis can be executed by running the following on the MyST Studio host.\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/update-database.sh \nThis step will perform an outage of the MyST Studio instance. This outage should be no longer than 5 minutes.\nThe following steps are performed as part of the database update.\nThe MyST Studio web instance is stopped.\nThe backup SQL is executed on the database\nThe MyST Studio web instance is started.\nStep 3: Verify the downgrade\nAt a minimum, the following downgrade verification steps should be performed.\nCheck there are no errors shown in the MyST Studio start up log\nLogin to the MyST Studio console and check that the version shown in the bottom right-hand corner is correct.\nPros / Cons\nPros:\n\nAllows for an upgrade to be tested before introducing it to production\nProvides a sandbox for testing configuration prior to moving to productionCons:\n\nRequires an outage to perform an upgrade\nIf not using the same data as production (i.e. skipping step 2), it may not be an accurate upgrade verification for production.\nMore complex to setup than single instance\n\nZero Downtime Upgrade\nWith this upgrade strategy, there is two instances (blue and green). At any given time, the DNS record will point to one of the two instances. This allows for an upgrade to be performed on the non-active instance in isolation and once ready, the DNS record can be updated to point traffic to this instance. This approach has the benefit of there not being any outage required when performing the upgrade.\nUpgrade Steps\nBelow are the steps for upgrading our green instance and switching over from our blue instance. If our green instance were the active instance we would reverse blue and green in the below steps.\nStep 1: Download the latest version of MyST Studio on the green instance\nThis can be executed by running the following command.\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/pull.sh \nIf internet access is not available from the MyST Studio host this will need to be performed manually by downloading the Docker image from the MyST website and performing the following steps.\ndocker load -i \ndocker tag  myst-studio\nStep 2: Set blue repository to read-only (optional)\nPrior to upgrading the instance, we will take an export of our blue instance database. During this period, if a user were to make a change on the blue instance it would be lost when we switch over to the green instance. In order to prevent changes, you may wish to make the blue repository read-only as follows:\ndocker exec -ti myststudio_db mysql -u root -pwelcome1\nmysql> FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;\nmysql> SET GLOBAL read_only = ON;\nmysql> exit\nStep 3: Take a copy of the latest blue instance state and import to the green instance\nThe involves first taking a copy of blue database of MyST Studio by executing the following\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/backup-database.sh\nThe location of the backup will be output to the terminal.\nNext, the backup will need to be copied to the green host and the following will need to be executed.\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/update-database.sh \nThis step will shutdown and restart the MyST Studio web instance. Because we previously downloaded the latest MyST Studio, it will be upgraded to the latest MyST Studio version on startup.\nBe sure to disable the read only mode on the database by executing the following:\ndocker exec -ti myststudio_db mysql -u root -pwelcome1\nmysql> SET GLOBAL read_only = OFF;\nmysql> UNLOCK TABLES;\nmysql> exit\nStep 4: Verify the upgrade on the green instance\nAt a minimum, the following upgrade verification steps should be performed.\nCheck there are no errors shown in the MyST Studio start up log\nLogin to the MyST Studio console and check that the version shown in the bottom right-hand corner is correct.\nStep 5: If upgrade is successful, switch the DNS record to point to the green instance\nThis would simply involve updating the DNS record which is currently pointing to the blue instance so that it points to the green instance.\nFor the next upgrade, the DNS record will be pointed back to the blue instance.\nRollback Steps\nThe rollback process is straight forward for Blue / Green. If an issue is encountered during the upgrade process then it won't impact the active instance so there is no rollback required other than setting the instance back from read-only if this was set.\nPros / Cons\nPros\n\nAllows for an upgrade to be tested without any production outage\nTakes the pressure off an upgrade by allowing it to be done independently of an outage\nBuild-in DR strategyCons\n\nMore complex to setup than single instance\nWhile the database is in read-only, any builds from the CI server (e.g. Jenkins) will not be propagated to MyST Studio. The would need to be re-run afterwards for all the failed build jobs.\n\nOffline Upgrade\nIf you are unable to provide access to the MyST Docker Registry either directly or via Proxy Server, you will need to perform the upgrade process offline. This will require pre-downloading the Docker Image from myst.rubiconred.com (to do this you will need to login) and copying the image up to the MyST host. Once this is done, perform the following:\n\nChange directory to /u01/myst-studio/bin\nExecute backup-database.sh script to take the backup of the current state.\nExecute stop.sh to stop the MyST instance.\nGunzip the installer file using below commandgunzip myst-studio-docker-image-.tar.gz\n\nLoad the MyST Studio docker image using below commandsudo docker load -i myst-studio-docker-image-.tar\n\nTag the image to myst-studiodocker tag 067343992071.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/myst-studio: myst-studio\n\nExecute start.sh script to start the MyST Studio in the new version.\n\nUpgrading from CLI to Studio\nMyST CLI users will have a MyST Workspace which is a folder for storing Platform Blueprints and Models in XML or Properties notation. The easiest way to start managing these Platform Instances outside the MyST CLI is to first push them to up to MyST Studio. This can be done by executing the following from the MyST Workspace.\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/cli2studio -h localhost -p 443\n...where in the example above MyST Studio is running on localhost:443\n"},"appendix/artifact/":{"url":"appendix/artifact/","title":"Supported Artifacts","keywords":"","body":"Supported Artifacts\n\n\nProperty Exclusions\nIntegration Cloud Archive\nProcess Cloud Archive\nSCA\nOSB\nMDS\nADF\nJava EAR\nJava WAR\nSQL\nB2B\nBAM\nMFT\nApplication Configuration (Properties/XML)\nOSB Custom XPath\nOWSM Policy\nJAR Library\nJava Shared Library\n\n\nProperty Exclusions\nA list of artifact properties excluded from being published to MyST Studio.

These artifact types can be deployed to either Oracle Integration Cloud or the Legacy Integration Cloud Service. For each version of an Oracle Integration Cloud Archive which you wish to deploy, you must first register it with MyST. These steps can be performed manually, however, it is recommended to include these steps in a CI server job, so that they can be triggered automatically as required.\nStep 1: Export your Integration Cloud Archive\nWe can export either from the Oracle Integration Cloud console, Integration Cloud Service console or via the REST API for either service.\nTo export via the Oracle Integration Cloud console:\n\nNavigate to Integrations within the Oracle Integration Cloud console\nDownload the Integration. This will download a file with the .iar file extension.\n\n     \n       \n     \nTo export via the Oracle Integration Cloud REST API:\n\nEnsure you have curl installed and are running on a Linux based machine\nSet the following environmental variables to match your environment:OIC_USERNAME=\"your-email@your-company.com\"\nOIC_PASSWORD=\"your-password\"\nOIC_HOST=\"your-instance.uscom-central-1.oraclecloud.com\"\nOIC_ICS_PROJECT_ID=\"ECHO|01.00.0000\"\nOIC_ICS_EXPORT_FILE_NAME=\"ECHO_01.00.0000.iar\"\n\nThe OIC_ICS_PROJECT_ID can be obtained by combining the integration identifier with the version. These details can be found under the Primary Info menu item for the integration.\n     \n       \n     \nExecute the following to export your project.curl -u ${OIC_USERNAME}:${OIC_PASSWORD} \\\nhttps://${OIC_HOST}/ic/api/integration/v1/integrations/${OIC_ICS_PROJECT_ID}/archive > ${OIC_ICS_EXPORT_FILE_NAME}\nIf using the Legacy Integration Cloud Service, then use the following insteadcurl -u ${OIC_USERNAME}:${OIC_PASSWORD} \\\nhttps://${OIC_HOST}/icsapi/v2/integrations/${OIC_ICS_PROJECT_ID}/archive > ${OIC_ICS_EXPORT_FILE_NAME}\n\n\nStep 2: Create the Maven pom.xml\n\nCreate a pom.xml. Be sure to set the Maven details to match your environment. An example pom.xml is shown below.\n\n4.0.0\ncom.rubiconred\nRetrieveAllAirlines\njar\n1.0-SNAPSHOT\nRetrieve All Airlines\n\n opaas-ics\n RetrieveAllAirlines\n (EMBEDDED)/ics.json\n\n\n \n   \n     ${project.basedir}\n     \n       pom.xml\n     \n   \n \n\n\n\n\nMyST supports the following PCS-specific deploy-time properties being defined with the Maven pom.xml.\n\n\n\nProperty\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nics.configuration-plan\nOptional: Used for defining configuration for the integration connections. The file can be a path on the target host or a path in the packaged artifact (e.g. (EMBEDDED)/ics.json).\n\n\nics.deployment-name\nOptional: Name of the deployed application. If not set, it will default to the Maven artifactId\n\n\n\nStep 3: Create a configuration plan (Optional)\nIf the integration has connections, then these will need to be defined in a JSON file that is packaged with the artifact itself. Below is an example configuration containing two REST API connections.\n{\n    \"connections\": {\n        \"FLIGHTAIRLINESREST\": {\n            \"connectionProperties\": [\n                {\n                    \"propertyValue\": \"https://${flights.api.host}\",\n                    \"propertyName\": \"connectionUrl\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        \"LOGGERREST\": {\n           \"connectionProperties\": [\n                {\n                    \"propertyValue\": \"https://${logger.api.host}\",\n                    \"propertyName\": \"connectionUrl\"\n                }\n           ]\n        }\n    }\n}\nProperty references (e.g. flights.api.host and logger.api.host in the example above) will be automatically made available as artifact properties in MyST. These properties can be defined with different values per environment.\nThe connection identifiers (e.g. FLIGHTAIRLINESREST and LOGGERREST in the example above) must match the identifiers of the connections shown in the console. These identifier for a given connection can be found by clicking on Primary Info when viewing the connection.\nEach connection type may have different available properties. The available properties for a given connection can be obtained by calling the connection through a GET API call on https://${OIC_HOST}/ic/api/integration/v1/connections/${OIC_CONNECTION_ID}.\nMake sure the location of the JSON file is indicated against the ics.configuration-plan property in the pom.xml.\nStep 4: Unpack the archive to the version control system (Optional)\nWhilst it is possible to publish the artifact directly to Maven. It is recommended to rebuild the artifact from source. This will ensure that individual files changes are version controlled. This approach also allows for the configuration plan to be easily packaged alongside the artifact. An unpacked Integration Cloud Archive has a structure similar to the following\n├── ics.json\n├── icspackage\n│   ├── appinstances\n│   │   ├── FLIGHTAIRLINESREST.xml\n│   │   └── LOGGERREST.xml\n│   └── project\n│       └── RETRIEVEALLAIRLINES_01.00.0000\n│           ├── PROJECT-INF\n│           │   └── project.xml\n│           ├── ics_project_attributes.properties\n│           └── resources\n└── pom.xml\nStep 5: Set a unique version number for our artifact\nWhen publish an artifact to Maven and later registering it with MyST, it is important to ensure that the version number of the artifact is unique. This can be done via Maven prior to building the artifact. An example of this is described\nhere.\nStep 6: Build and publish your application to a Maven Repository\nWe can achieve the build and publish using Maven. For example:\nmvn clean deploy\nAlternatively, if we skipped step 3 and 4 and would rather publish our artifact directly to Maven, we may wish to do this directly using the deploy:deploy-file goal. For example:\nmvn deploy:deploy-file -Durl=http://admin:password@your-myst-instance.com/artifactory/libs-release-local \\\n-Dfile=RetrieveAllAirlines.iar \\\n-DgroupId=com.rubiconred \\\n-DartifactId=RetrieveAllAirlines \\\n-Dversion=1.0-${BUILD_NUMBER} \\\n-Dpackaging=jar\nBe sure to publish to the same Artifact Repository that is defined within the MyST Continuous Delivery Profile. This ensures that MyST will be able to retrieve the artifact at deploy-time.\nStep 7: Register the artifact with MyST\nThis can be achieved through the MyST Java SDK or via the REST API. Alternatively, if you are using Jenkins, you can use the MyST Jenkins Plugin.\nOnce the Artifact is registered with MyST it can be added to a new or existing Application Blueprint and promoted across Oracle Integration Cloud or Integration Cloud Service instances using a Release Pipeline.\nProcess Cloud Archive\nOracle Process Cloud Archives can be deployed using MyST. These artifact types can be deployed to either Oracle Integration Cloud or the Legacy Process Cloud Service. For each version of an Oracle Process Cloud Archive which you wish to deploy, you must first register it with MyST. These steps can be performed manually, however, it is recommended to include these steps in a CI server job, so that they can be triggered automatically as required.\nStep 1: Export your Process Cloud Archive\nWe can export either from the Oracle Integration Cloud console, Process Cloud Service console or via the REST API for either service.\nTo export via the Oracle Integration Cloud console:\n\nNavigate to Process Builder then Applications within the Oracle Integration Cloud console\nDownload the Application. This will download a file with the .exp file extension.\n     \n       \n     \n\nTo export via the Oracle Integration Cloud REST API:\n\nEnsure you have curl and jq installed and are running on a Linux based machine\nSet the following environmental variables to match your environment:OIC_USERNAME=\"your-email@your-company.com\"\nOIC_PASSWORD=\"your-password\"\nOIC_HOST=\"your-instance.uscom-central-1.oraclecloud.com\"\nOIC_PCS_PROJECT_ID=\"Administer%20Patient%20Well%20Being\"\nOIC_PCS_SPACE_NAME=\"RxR\"\nOIC_PCS_EXPORT_FILE_NAME=\"AdministerPatientWellBeing.exp\"\n\nEnsure OIC_PCS_SPACE_NAME matches the design-time space where your Process Application is located. In the example above, it is in the RxR space.\nAlso, ensure that any space character in your project name is replaced with the %20 character.\nExecute the following to export your project.export OIC_PCS_SPACE_ID=$(curl -u ${OIC_USERNAME}:${OIC_PASSWORD} https://${OIC_HOST}/bpm/api/4.0/spaces/ | jq -r \".items[] | select( .name == \\\"${OIC_PCS_SPACE_NAME}\\\") | .id\")\ncurl -u ${OIC_USERNAME}:${OIC_PASSWORD} https://${OIC_HOST}/ic/api/process/v1/spaces/${OIC_PCS_SPACE_ID}/projects/${OIC_PCS_PROJECT_ID}/exp > ${OIC_PCS_EXPORT_FILE_NAME}\n\n\nTo export via the Process Cloud Service console:\n\nNavigate to Develop Processes within the Process Cloud console\nDownload the Application. This will download a file with the .exp file extension.\n     \n       \n     \n\nTo export via the Process Cloud Service REST API:\n\nEnsure you have curl and jq installed and are running on a Linux based machine\nSet the following environmental variables to match your environment:PCS_USERNAME=\"your-email@your-company.com\"\nPCS_PASSWORD=\"your-password\"\nPCS_HOST=\"your-instance.process.us2.oraclecloud.com\"\nPCS_PROJECT_ID=\"Administer%20Patient%20Well%20Being\"\nPCS_SPACE_NAME=\"RxR\"\nPCS_EXPORT_FILE_NAME=\"AdministerPatientWellBeing.exp\"\n\nEnsure PCS_SPACE_NAME matches the design-time space where your Process Application is located. In the example above, it is in the RxR space.\nAlso, ensure that any space character in your project name is replaced with the %20 character.\n\n\nExecute the following to export your project.export PCS_SPACE_ID=$(curl -u ${PCS_USERNAME}:${PCS_PASSWORD} https://${PCS_HOST}/bpm/api/4.0/spaces/ | jq -r \".items[] | select( .name == \\\"${PCS_SPACE_NAME}\\\") | .id\")\ncurl -u ${PCS_USERNAME}:${PCS_PASSWORD} https://${PCS_HOST}/bpm/api/4.0/spaces/${PCS_SPACE_ID}/projects/${PCS_PROJECT_ID}/exp > ${PCS_EXPORT_FILE_NAME}\n\n\nAt the time of writing, Oracle do not support automated deployment of Decision Model Applications. Therefore, MyST is only able to support deployment of Process Applications at this time.\nStep 2: Create the Maven pom.xml\n\nCreate a pom.xml. Be sure to set the Maven details to match your environment. An example pom.xml is shown below.\n\n4.0.0\ncom.rubiconred\nAdministerPatientWellBeing\njar\n1.0-SNAPSHOT\nAdminister Patient Well Being\n\n opaas-pcs\n Administer Patient Well Being\n RxR\n\n\n \n   \n     org.apache.maven.plugins\n     maven-shade-plugin\n     \n       \n         package\n         \n           shade\n         \n         \n           \n             \n               *:*\n               \n                 META-INF/\n               \n             \n           \n         \n       \n     \n   \n \n \n   \n     ${project.basedir}\n     \n       pom.xml*\n     \n   \n \n\n\n\n\nMyST supports the following PCS-specific deploy-time properties being defined with the Maven pom.xml.\n\n\n\nProperty\nDescription\n\n\n\n\npcs.space-name\nDesign-time space for the given project. If the application already exists in the design-time space, it will be overwritten.\n\n\npcs.configuration-plan\nOptional: A custom deployment configuration JSON payload in the format of the REST API call for deploying Process Applications. The file can be a path on the target host or a path in the packaged artifact (e.g. (EMBEDDED)/pcs.json).\n\n\npcs.deployment-name\nOptional: Name of the deployed application. If not set, it will default to the Maven artifactId\n\n\n\nStep 3: Create a configuration plan (Optional)\nBy default, Process Applications are deployed with the following configuration plan\n{\n  \"revisionId\": \"1.0\",\n  \"overwrite\": true,\n  \"forceDefault\": true\n}\nTo use an alternative configuration plan, create a file at the same directory as the pom.xml so that it will be included in the artifact when it is built. Make sure the location of this file is indicated against the pcs.configuration-plan property in the pom.xml.\nStep 4: Unpack the archive to the version control system (Optional)\nWhilst it is possible to publish the artifact directly to Maven. It is recommended to rebuild the artifact from source. This will ensure that individual files changes are version controlled. This approach also allows for the configuration plan to be easily packaged alongside the artifact. An unpacked archive has a structure similar to the following\n├── Administer\\ Patient\\ Well\\ Being\n│   └── SOA\n│       ├── HumanTasks\n│       ├── Schemas\n│       ├── WADLs\n│       ├── WSDLs\n│       ├── businessCatalog\n│       ├── businessIndicators.bi\n│       ├── composite.xml\n│       ├── connectors\n│       ├── contentMetadata.xml\n│       ├── forms\n│       ├── kpis.kpi\n│       ├── measurementActions.xml\n│       ├── measurements.xml\n│       ├── organization.xml\n│       ├── processes\n│       ├── projectInfo.xml\n│       ├── resources\n│       ├── simulations\n│       ├── socialMetadata.xml\n│       ├── wsm-assembly.xml\n│       └── xsl\n├── pcs.json\n└── pom.xml\nStep 5: Set a unique version number for our artifact\nWhen publish an artifact to Maven and later registering it with MyST, it is important to ensure that the version number of the artifact is unique. This can be done via Maven prior to building the artifact. An example of this is described\nhere.\nStep 6: Build and publish your application to a Maven Repository\nWe can achieve the build and publish using Maven.
