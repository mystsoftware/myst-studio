Each user has an individual account that at a minimum includes a unique login id, username and password.

Within MyST, **users** are not assigned permissions directly, but only acquire them through the **role\(s\)** assigned to them within one or more **workspaces**.

Users can also be assigned System Roles, which will enable them to manage system specific configurations.

### List Users

To see a list of MyST Users, click  `Administration` &gt; `Users`. This will display a list of Users similar to the one below.

### Activate \/ Deactivate User

By default, when you create a User, it is in an active state. Meaning that the user is able to log into MyST and perform any actions for which they have been granted privileges.

To disable access to MyST, we can deactivate the User Account.

**Note**:

* Deactivating a User account does not remove any workspaces roles they have been granted, but prevents them from logging in and performing any of those roles.
* A deactivated User account can be reactivated at any time.

To deactivate a User account; click on the  **Actions** drop-down menu for the corresponding User and select `Deactivate` as illustrated below.

To delete a User account; click on the  **Actions** drop-down menu for the corresponding User and select `Delete`. We will be prompted to confirm out action, click `Yes` to proceed.

When deleted the user will be removed from any workspaces to which they belong.
