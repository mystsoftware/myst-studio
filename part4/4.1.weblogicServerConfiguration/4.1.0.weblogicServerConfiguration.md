### Server Startup Arguments
Server Startup Arguments are used for providing arguments to the Java Virtual Machine for specific WebLogic Server instances. These are most commonly used for configuring memory settings. 

MyST makes it simple to configure the server startup arguments on a per-product basis. For Server Startup Arguments, MyST automatically generates a property under `Global Variables` for each product, with the naming convention `<product-id>.args`. 

When we create our Platform Model, the WebLogic server instances are generated by MyST, which automatically reference the appropriate property. 

> This makes is easy to define a common property once to be used across a number of WebLogic Server instances in a cluster rather than managing each Server's properties separately like you would have to do when using the WebLogic Administration Console to do manual configuration.

So for exampe, if we have a SOA domain, containing both SOA and OSB, then MyST would generate the Global Variables `osb.args` and `soa.args`as illustrated below.

Server Startup Arguments defined with the convention `<product-id>.args` are applied during start up by the WebLogic Node Manager. This is **different** to those defined with the convention `<server-id>.userMemArgs` which are instead applied by manipulating the start up scripts directly. 

Due to a WebLogic product constraint the Admin Server arguments are unable to be managed by the Node Manager. Thus Admin Server start up arguments should be defined using the property `admin.server.userMemArgs`. MyST automatically does this for you by default (as illustrated above).

> In 11g, Coherence cluster arguments were required to be defined under the server start arguments. As this is a complex and error-prone process, MyST Studio will automatically generate this for you when you have products in your Blueprint that use Coherence out of the box, such as SOA Suite. You don't have to worry about missing this step or making a mistake.

#### Configure Environment Specific Startup Arguments in the Platform Model
It's quite common to provide less resources to a Development or Testing environment compared to Production. As a result these environments often require different memory settings.

MyST makes it simple to override the startup arguments defined in the Platform Blueprint by configuring environment specific Startup arguments in our Platform Model. 

To do this, navigate to the Global Variables within the Platform Model. By default MyST will show the start-up arguments inherited from the Platform Blueprint. To override these simply edit the values as required within the Platform Model.

> We also havethe option of overriding the startup arguments when we first create the Platform Model by specifying these on the [Advanced tab of the Platform Model Configuration](/part3/3.4.editPlatformBlueprint/3.4.2.platformBlueprintEditor.md#override) stage of the Platform Model wizard.

### Startup and Shutdown Classes
WebLogic allows us to configure startup and shutdown classes in order to perform tasks when we start up or gracefully shut down the server. 

A startup class is a Java program that is automatically loaded and executed when a WebLogic Server is started or restarted. For information about when WebLogic Server loads and executes startup classes, see "Ordering Startup Class Execution and Deployment."

A shutdown class is a Java program that is automatically loaded and executed when the WebLogic Server is shut down either from the Administration Console or the weblogic.admin shutdown command. 

To use startup or shutdown classes, you must configure and assign them to servers or clusters. 

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Name | x |
| Target | The cluster to which the class is to be deployed |
| Class Name | Fully qualified name of the Java class |
| Deployment Order | Determines order in which classes are loaded and executed. Items with the lowest Deployment Order value are loaded first. priority is relative to other deployable items of the same type. |
| Arguments | Arguments that the WebLogic server uses to initialize a class. Multiple arguments must be separated with a comma. For example: 
attribute1=value1,attribute2=value2 |
| Load Before App Deplyments | x |
| Load Before App Activation | x |


#### Ordering Startup Class Execution and Deployment
By default WebLogic Server startup classes are run after the server initializes JMS and JDBC services, and after applications and standalone modules have been deployed.

If you want to perform startup tasks after JMS and JDBC services are available, but before applications and modules have been activated, you can select the Run Before Application Deployments option

LoadBeforeAppDeployments attribute to "true

LoadBeforeAppActivation attribute to "true"

> Note: The startup or shutdown class must be on the classpath of each server to which it is assigned. See [Configure Server Startup Arguments](tbc) for further details.
